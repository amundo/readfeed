We had <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/2022/\">a hell of a 2022</a> and so I&#8217;m only just now getting the opportunity to write about my best bud. Thankfully, I&#8217;ve had a year to work through my grief, so I can arrive at this difficult task with a better perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The origin story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a dog was a bribe to get Melissa to move from NYC to Pittsburgh. I was eager to move closer to family, but Melissa was reluctant. In retrospect, I didn&#8217;t handle any of that transition well, but &#8220;we can get a dog!&#8221; proved to be an effective bargaining chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We arrived in Pittsburgh at the beginning of July 2012, and by the end of the month this guy entered the scene:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-13-at-16.08.56@2x-1024x864.png\" alt=\"Ziggy as a 3-month old puppy, smiling with his tongue out.\" class=\"wp-image-17045\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-13-at-16.08.56@2x-1024x864.png 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-13-at-16.08.56@2x-700x590.png 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-13-at-16.08.56@2x-768x648.png 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-13-at-16.08.56@2x.png 1072w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Melissa&#8217;s college roommate had a cousin who just bred a litter of English bulldogs, and we swung by a small town in Virginia on our way to our annual family vacation. We were smitten! So we swung by on our return trip, and Ziggy helped drop me off at <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/thanks-an-event-apart/\">my first formative An Event Apart</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DF23547F-C257-4DDE-8534-84ADD7734C42-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Ziggy the 3-month old puppy in the back seat of a car\" class=\"wp-image-17047\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DF23547F-C257-4DDE-8534-84ADD7734C42-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DF23547F-C257-4DDE-8534-84ADD7734C42-700x700.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DF23547F-C257-4DDE-8534-84ADD7734C42-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DF23547F-C257-4DDE-8534-84ADD7734C42.jpg 1224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I never had a dog before. Our neighbors growing up had annoying dogs so I grew up indifferent or even a little annoyed by them. Ziggy immediately changed all of that, and now it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine myself being on the fence about dogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2012-07-28-15.30.07-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A shaggy-haired Brad and Melissa smiling with Ziggy the puppy in their arms\" class=\"wp-image-17061\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2012-07-28-15.30.07-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2012-07-28-15.30.07-700x700.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2012-07-28-15.30.07-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2012-07-28-15.30.07.jpg 1351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/644014_10100788355156819_1455641371_n.jpg\" alt=\"Brad and Ziggy smiling\" class=\"wp-image-17049\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first apartment in Pittsburgh was a hideous place, but the concrete floors made cleaning up puppy pee easy and also provided us the perfect skateboarding training park.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"709\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-14-at-09.35.48@2x-1024x709.png\" alt=\"Ziggy on a skateboard looking at a bone.\" class=\"wp-image-17065\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-14-at-09.35.48@2x-1024x709.png 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-14-at-09.35.48@2x-700x485.png 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-14-at-09.35.48@2x-768x532.png 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CleanShot-2023-04-14-at-09.35.48@2x.png 1198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"698\" height=\"932\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7882-MOTION.gif\" alt=\"An animated Gif of Ziggy sitting in Bra'd lap\" class=\"wp-image-17062\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ziggy in Lawrenceville</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We eventually moved to the Lawrenceville neighborhood in Pittsburgh, where Ziggy quickly became a staple character along Butler Street and at the dog park down the street from our house.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8909-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Ziggy with a big beard made out of mud\" class=\"wp-image-17073\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8909-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8909-700x700.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8909-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8909-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_8909.jpg 1961w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ziggy as Captain Mudbeard</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-700x875.jpg\" alt=\"Ziggy standing in front of the Deli on Butler St\" class=\"wp-image-17091\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-700x875.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20170823_125054_881-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite things about Ziggy was his ability to make even the saltiest yinzers chuckle and smile.

But it was less of a &#8220;I want to go home&#8221; stop. It was a crisp, clear morning and the sun was shining. Ziggy just sat there for a long time, soaking in the sun, mostly with his eyes closed. I obviously can&#8217;t know what was going on in his head, but he seemed to be telling me that his time was coming soon. In that still of the morning sun, we reflected on the beautiful life we shared over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PXL_20220211_135056201.PORTRAIT-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Ziggy standing in a snowy field looking out over a park.\" class=\"wp-image-17040\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PXL_20220211_135056201.PORTRAIT-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PXL_20220211_135056201.PORTRAIT-700x525.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PXL_20220211_135056201.PORTRAIT-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PXL_20220211_135056201.PORTRAIT-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PXL_20220211_135056201.PORTRAIT-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The night he passed away, he hovered over Ella in her bed as if to say goodbye. Shortly after, he started having a hard time breathing; we raced to the hospital and he ultimately died in my arms as I rushed towards the hospital door. I wish he didn&#8217;t die in such spectacular fashion as the traumatic memory of that night really gets in the way of the decade&#8217;s worth of beautiful memories and shared time together. But I&#8217;m confident that will dissipate over time. I already feel the grief turning into gratitude, and that&#8217;s exactly what should happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for everything, Ziggy. I love you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-700x875.jpg\" alt=\"Ziggy standing on some traintracks with a sunset in the background.\" class=\"wp-image-17095\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-700x875.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-768x960.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_20171102_183330_515-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n",

Shifting away from more heady topics like <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/some-thoughts-on-ais-impact-on-digital-design-and-development/\">AI&#8217;s impact on design and development</a>, I felt like talking about the importance of choosing a name for your design system. Give it a listen:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Naming design systems\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DiMZmIFzKjU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s in a name?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we say &#8220;design systems create a shared language&#8221;,  <em>a lot</em> hinges on creating agreement on the specific names for things. We can talk about many many many different aspects of naming across the design system universe, but for now let&#8217;s stick with the formal name of a design system, such as Material Design, Lightning Design System, Carbon Design System, or everyone&#8217;s favorite Polaris (please don&#8217;t use Polaris; it&#8217;s played out now).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many benefits of choosing a formal name for your design system:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A helpful shorthand</strong> &#8211; A design system&#8217;s name is its brand name, and that name becomes a shorthand that encapsulates and embodies what the whole effort is about.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mitigates confusion</strong> &#8211; many organizations have different permutations and generations of design systems floating around. Having a name that is distinct from &#8220;our company&#8217;s design system&#8221; can really helps clarify things. A design system called Splat allows people to say &#8220;Splat&#8217;s design tokens&#8221;,  &#8220;Splat&#8217;s accordion&#8221;, and so on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creates a global namespace</strong> &#8211; Having a distinct global namespace for a design system is really important: it prevents collisions with non-design system code, creates a useful web component namespace, unlocks the ability to measure adoption, and more. So if the name is Splat, you could define <code>splat-card</code>, <code>splat-button</code>, <code>splat</code>-accordion and so on in CSS and code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Helps with marketing efforts</strong> &#8211; a brand name for the design system helps disseminate it around the organization. It can be helpful, exciting, and fun to have a real product name floating around. We&#8217;ve had clients create Christmas ornaments, t-shirts, mugs, and other swag. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose a name for your design system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you go about creating a name for your design system? We&#8217;ve done it a host of different ways across many organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Someone just picks a name and rolls with it.</strong> Super straightforward but potentially myopic and problematic.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brainstorming sessions</strong> within the design system team, and <strong>put things up to a vote</strong> with the team and any stakeholders.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create a Slack channel</strong> dedicated to a name. We had this once and the conversation quickly devolved into obscure Greek mythology. It was funny. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However you arrive at the name, there are a few things to consider: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The nature of the organization</strong> &#8211; picking a clever name that is thematically aligned with the nature of the business can lead to excitement, and can also be just plain fun. We worked with PetSmart on their Sparky design system, United Airlines on their Atmos design system, Caterpillar on their Blocks design system, and many others.  </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bureaucratic red tape</strong> &#8211; we&#8217;ve worked with a number of organizations that require legal and/or brand approval for any name. Identify those things early before you get too far down the road.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Roll out the name across the board</strong> &#8211; Use the name consistently. That sounds like a &#8220;no duh&#8221; point, but it can be tricky when existing Figma libraries, code repositories, and documentation are floating around. It&#8217;s really important to have those existing assets to adopt the new language, even if it means having to release a breaking change.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Working titles as a stop gap</strong> &#8211; If you can&#8217;t reach consensus for a name, it&#8217;s important to pick a working title so you&#8217;re not blocked from getting things done. This especially matters on the code end of things, such as picking a repository name, the global namespace in code, etc. If the name changes, a quick find-and-replace can update things, but don&#8217;t let the lack of official name prevent you from getting to work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s that! Formally name for your design system, and start using that name clearly and consistently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you find these little videos helpful. if you have any feedback, comments, suggestions, or whatever, just let me know!</p>\n",

I am here with someone that I&#8217;ve been wanting to speak to for so long. I&#8217;ll give you the backstory of it, so you know why. We have recorded over 75 episodes. I think we get over 200 listened over for each episode. I cannot thank you enough. We are bringing more interesting people. The person I&#8217;m speaking to, I need to give a very, very, very, very, very special introduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First time I bump into him, well, his work, was long time back, when I was working for a design agency, and we were trying to design a big website platform for enterprise, and I was sitting on my desk first day, hired, energized. The project manager came in with a big, big pile of A4s wrapped, tied together. Sort of felt like a book. He threw it on my desk, he was like, &#8220;Behrad, for this project, we are going to follow Atomic Design framework.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know why, Brad, he printed it, it was a long time ago, so not sure, I didn&#8217;t ask really. But, I started reading the book and I was really fascinated by how you broke down the, basically, components that designers use in their day-to-day work into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. Since then, I was like, &#8220;That makes so much sense.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward, after seven years or so, I&#8217;m here with the one and only Brad Frost, author of <a href=\"https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">Atomic Design</a>, the most important relevant book on design system still to this date. So, if you haven&#8217;t read it, read it, it makes all sense to you after you read it, why you need design system. Really excited to have him here. It&#8217;s everyday I open my Twitter and look at ChatGPT-3, 4, and new revolutions of slew of AI products, how it&#8217;s revolutionizing the work of digital product designers. Oh my goodness, how it&#8217;s basically putting design system even more on the map. Hopefully, we can get to talk about that, whether Brad is agreeing to it or not. Long introduction. Brad, how are you doing today? Thanks for coming on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah, thank you so much for having me, and that was a really, really kind and enthusiastic introduction. I really appreciate that. I&#8217;m doing great today, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to our conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Brad, it&#8217;s been a long journey for you. Design systems are not a new topic to you. You&#8217;ve been dealing with this for such a long time. If you want to look back and see how the concept of design system has evolved, yeah, how do you see it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>It&#8217;s an interesting time to be reflecting on this because actually as it happens this year, Atomic Design turns 10 years old. So, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, so that&#8217;s something.&#8221; But, obviously the notion of design systems has been around in some way, shape or form for a while. But, I&#8217;ll walk through what that last kind of 10 years has looked like. So as I set out on my own, and at the time, around 2010 through 2013, it was  responsive design, right? That this was the thing, and that that was where I was coming from. I was working as a mobile web developer. That was a thing for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the time, and I was really fortunate to kind of be in that space because I worked for an agency that did work for brands like Nike and stuff, and so it was like, &#8220;Oh, we are working on a website for this new device that Apple is coming out with, and we want to launch nike.com,&#8221; and that thing was the iPad. So, it was kind of being there at that beginning stage of it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well, how do we do this? How do we create these experiences that work well on mobile devices, on these new emerging tablet devices as well as, of course, a bunch of different shapes of desktops and laptops and stuff?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that was what I was focused on. As I did that work, it became clear that it&#8217;s not, &#8220;Well, how do we get this whole site to become responsive?&#8221; A lot of it was just around, &#8220;Well, this stuff just kind of squishes, fine. But, the navigation, or this data table, or this carousel, or this this kind of thing, is tricky.&#8221; So, it wasn&#8217;t the entirety of a page that was hard to make responsive, it was certain components of that page that were hard. So, that led to a project that I called, <a href=\"https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/\">This Is Responsive</a>, which created, showcased and aggregated a bunch of responsive patterns. So, &#8220;Oh, here&#8217;s navigation and here&#8217;s seven different ways you could slice it.&#8221; So, that was my first voyage into thinking of things in terms of components versus like I&#8217;m just creating a webpage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around that same time, tools like Bootstrap and Foundation were starting to come on the scene and were like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s these components and you could build things out of them.&#8221; That was the state of things. There were a lot of pattern libraries, and really amazing people — <a href=\"https://www.maban.co.uk/\">Anna Debenham</a> comes to mind — doing important work, and say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s this pattern library and you can copy and paste this HTML, and here&#8217;s the thing, this style guide or pattern library,&#8221; and that was the language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I was doing that work, I found myself saying, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s great, this story of &#8216;Here&#8217;s components and you could build things out of those components.'&#8221; But I thought, &#8220;There&#8217;s not a lot of nuance there. There&#8217;s still a lot of room for interpretation error, and just it&#8217;s not entirely clear how these things come together to form full experiences.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s what led to the creation of <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">atomic design</a>, which was something like, &#8220;Okay, well there&#8217;s the smallest components, and then there&#8217;s simple components, and then there&#8217;s more complex components, and then those things all come together to form a whole user interface screen, and then we have different scenarios of that user interface screen,&#8221; and so that&#8217;s what atomic design became: a way to think about user interface as this very interconnected, hierarchical thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, it borrows from the natural world; you could blow up literally any piece of matter in the known universe and be left with this finite set of periodic elements that then combine into these simple molecules, which then keep combining into more complex things, which it ultimately becomes sometimes giant celestial bodies or whatever. It&#8217;s amazing, it&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s elegant, and it works, and it maps pretty nicely into this world of user interface design. So that was the birth of it, and as part of it, I created a tool called <a href=\"https://patternlab.io/\">Pattern Lab</a>, which was almost a precursor to what&#8217;s now the industry standard is <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a>. But, at the time we thought, &#8220;Well, we need a way to actually do this,&#8221; and so that was a tool that we created in order to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, along the way, just through a bunch of our client work, we were able to test this whole thing out. But, again, our clients weren&#8217;t asking for, &#8220;Please give us a design system or deliver us this pattern library.&#8221; It was a total kind of afterthought, they were hiring us to make them a new responsive website for brands like TechCrunch and Entertainment Weekly, which is a big US magazine publication. So what we were doing was delivering responsive websites, and along the way we are also delivering, saying, &#8220;Oh, by the way, here&#8217;s this really thoughtful pattern library.&#8221; And our clients were like, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s nice, *trash can*.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t have any use or see any utility in it, they weren&#8217;t really interested in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, over time, it started becoming more and more of a concept. So, the term design systems really kind of started to take root in maybe 2015-ish or whatever. I remember it was the tail end of me writing my book that I went back through and started replacing the word pattern library with design system a little bit. So, it was that concept started taking hold, I think, around then. Then, since then, it&#8217;s been more of an explicit thing that organizations are asking for, and are starting to see, as we just have so many things and different pieces of software scattered across an organization. Everybody, teams of people the world over, are creating the same buttons, the same accordions, the same form fields, the same whatever. You take 20 different teams and 20 different buttons and 20 different text fields and stuff, it makes a lot of sense to say, &#8220;Hey, maybe we should just do this once and just put it in one place, so that everybody then uses.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s been the journey to the present day, and now it&#8217;s really exciting because this stuff is proving its value. It&#8217;s hard to do, it&#8217;s hard to get right, largely from a people perspective. It&#8217;s not technically from a design perspective. From a development perspective, this stuff is easy. You ask any designer on the planet to say, &#8220;Hey, design a button.&#8221; Or any developer, say, &#8220;Hey, develop a button.&#8221; It&#8217;s the easiest thing in the world. You could knock that out in an hour, but that&#8217;s not really the challenge of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Let&#8217;s stay here, because you made a really good point, and from the people standpoint, it&#8217;s very hard to put together a design system for big organization. Why is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>It&#8217;s a lot of reasons. I think it ultimately boils down to different people doing different things and having a different set of priorities. I think that that&#8217;s the most charitable and natural thing; if you are a company and you have several software products: a marketing site, maybe a piece of software that users buy and then log into, okay, there&#8217;s two things right there. So, you have a marketing site and then you have the actual product. Those things have different goals, those have different priorities, they have different roadmaps, they have different teams working on them. So, just things like that, which is kind of a natural thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you multiply that&#8230; A lot of our work is with big Fortune 500 companies and companies like that. When you multiply that into you now have dozens and dozens and dozens of different pockets of the organization, building different websites, building different native apps, building kiosks, building emails, building the whole nine yards, and you have a bunch of these people all just pointing in different directions that have different priorities. From that perspective, it becomes really hard to say, &#8220;Well, what I&#8217;m doing is actually similar to what these other folks are doing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody&#8217;s just kind of head down with their horse blinders on, and are focused on building great products, which is, again, that that&#8217;s what they should be doing. But, then, so what becomes the opportunity then is to say, &#8220;Okay, we still need to have these people that are actually focused on building the best products possible.&#8221; That with the marketing, website team needs to be working on making that marketing website the best marketing website that the Internet&#8217;s ever seen, and then the people who are working on the actual product, that the marketing site is selling, needs to be making the best product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that all makes sense, but then there becomes this thing of, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s this opportunity for either someone else or something else to be able to pull shared knowledge, shared assets, shared just things that ought to be shared, things that ought to be consistently rolled out thing, effort that should be shared to pull that down to a shared layer, that everyone can then make use of.&#8221; In that way, and this is the basic crux of the benefits that design system provide, is that rather than each one of those teams having to build that button from scratch or build that card from scratch or build that whatever from scratch, every single time they need it, they&#8217;re instead able to just pull from the toolkit and move on to bigger and more important product design and development decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>So, it&#8217;s been 10 years that you wrote that book, and fast forward, now we have in big organizations, even at small ones, you&#8217;ve got design system teams that their sole role, well, range of responsibilities is to maintain and develop design system. I&#8217;ve worked with several organizations that you need to make a request to the design system team if you want to introduce a new component, and that would go through a process of evaluation. If it gets approved, you could introduce that, and update the library. So, when you started writing the book, I mean, you didn&#8217;t necessarily have to look into the future, but did you foresee a future like this, that so much of product design process will be heavily impacted by the framework of design systems?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah, I think a bit of that. Whenever I wrote the book, a good deal of it was kind of focused on the mechanics, just we&#8217;ll say the basic concepts, but then also the process of how you go about making it. But, then I did tack on a chapter at the end that was maintaining a design system, and that was, again&#8230; The book&#8217;s about, what is it, seven years old? So, the concept&#8230; Maybe seven, close to eight, maybe, years old. But, the concept of Atomic Design is turning 10, but then the book came a little later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that stuff was still in its infancy. There weren&#8217;t a ton of teams out there that were doing this work of governing and growing and evolving a design system. It&#8217;s that stuff still is a little bit being defined and being refined a little bit. But, it does make sense when you consider these things and what they do and what they unlock, that just like plants, you got to keep watering them and you got to tend to them, and that if you don&#8217;t do that, they&#8217;re going to die, right? That&#8217;s just how that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it does make sense for there to be some effort in tending to these things. I think that some of the design system efforts that we&#8217;ve seen fail, a lot of times comes from that lack of ongoing tending and stuff like that, and also, we&#8217;ll say, a thoughtful governance. Now, it sounds like what you were just describing though of like this, &#8220;Oh yeah, we need to put in a request to the design system team,&#8221; and all of that, and that&#8217;s true and that process can exist. It&#8217;s also interesting that it&#8217;s, in our work, this is yet another reason why design systems are hard is that there&#8217;s an art to all of that stuff, which is to say, the design systems kind of move at a slower pace layer than product design, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, product design teams are like, &#8220;I have this ticket in front of me. I&#8217;m trying to get this feature done by the end of the sprint, and the design system team is kind of deliberately moving at a slower pace because they&#8217;re not just thinking about it through the lens of one thing, they&#8217;re considering things from a pretty holistic perspective,&#8221; and that naturally means they have to take longer, look at more things, make it more flexible and resilient, and test it more, and stuff like that, because if you just rush and just keep chucking a bunch of new components in because some person somewhere needs it, you&#8217;re going to end up with a mess on your hands pretty quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, anyways, so that that becomes a little bit of the art of it like, &#8220;How do you do this important, holistic, structural, systematic work, while also not being a giant blocker to every theme that has needs?&#8221; So, that becomes part of the process where it becomes &#8220;How do we establish a governance model, governance process? How do we establish good healthy relationships with or between all these different teams that are relying on this stuff, so that we all have visibility on the design system, and while the product teams are able to raise their hands and make suggestions and improvements and things like that, but without slowing everybody down to a snails pace.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I really agree with this statement that there&#8217;s a art to it, and if product teams, in coordination with design teams and tech teams, could arrive at a cadence that they could update and maintain design system, it would be hugely beneficial to them, because everyone would do less of busy work or boring work or tedious work, and they could just focus on parts of their process or part of their work that is exciting to them, and add more value to the business and customers at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly it. The way I see it, I see all of this through the lens of respect. Which is to say we want to be respectful of people&#8217;s time, energy, and talents, and when everybody is forced to put their brains on hold in order to draw and build more rectangles, it&#8217;s just not a respectful use of people&#8217;s time and talents, and I see a lot of this work as, &#8220;How do we unlock people&#8217;s potential? How do we unlock our different teams&#8217; potential? How do we free people up to focus on substantive and important issues?&#8221; Versus, &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t get around to that because I had to draw a card for the 17th time.&#8221; Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there&#8217;s some weird stuff that gets mixed in here because you have a bunch of people who have spent a bunch of years learning how to draw and build those rectangles. So, we see it a bit where it&#8217;s almost like a deer and headlights situation where we&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, you don&#8217;t have to do this stuff anymore,&#8221; and they&#8217;re just kind of like, &#8220;What do I do with my hands?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Do a million other things.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong> Other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>There is so much work to be done. No one comes out of the other end of a project. You launch a thing, there&#8217;s always work to be done, right? There&#8217;s always the things that you didn&#8217;t get around to doing, and it&#8217;s like what a lot of this design system work is is, again, freeing people&#8217;s brains and bodies up to execute more and better and more substantive stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Yeah, I think, us, in the product design community, we have to do, continuously now, soul searching of who we are as product designers. Because I&#8217;m talking to my team too, Brad, and I&#8217;m telling them that, &#8220;Get ready for our works to be disrupted on a faster regular pace than ever.&#8221; So, it could mean that for all of our illustrators, that they might not, for example, spend so much time behind Adobe Illustrator, or Blender, what have you, because this automation tools and AI tools is going to really take over a huge portion of their workflows, and I think it could be very unsettling for a lot of people, a lot of folks that they used to be, for example, do you remember folks drawing icons like [inaudible 00:26:33]?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost: </strong>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>It&#8217;s such a lovely&#8230; I used to go on YouTube and watch those fast forward videos that the icon designer would design every icon. It&#8217;s such a meditative Friday night with glass of red, I should say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>I know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know how to&#8230; I just wanted to get you in on this that I think all of us now need to be having this conversation with ourselves, with our team, that, &#8220;Okay, to what extent our works are getting disrupted? To what extent that we need to&#8230;&#8221; For example, if I used to do a lot of things with my hands, maybe now in the new age of work, not necessarily so, and then I have to find other ways to satisfy my needs of working with hands, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah, I think that that&#8217;s exactly right, and I think that you&#8217;re exactly right, and it&#8217;s a good piece of advice to really do that self reflection, to really do that assessment of what does it mean to be a product designer in this day and age, in the future. But, moreover, it&#8217;s just kind of like, &#8220;What do I like to do?&#8221; And I think that coming back to those people who have spent a lot of time, they find that meditative practice of going into a design tool and sweating the details and the thickness and the stroke width of an icon, it&#8217;s very interesting because it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, that is very satisfying work. That is really important work that is sweating that detail,&#8221; all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same holds true on the development side. There&#8217;s the smell of a brand new HTML page or CSS file or whatever. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Ah, this is great.&#8221; And now it is just worth saying, as a matter of fact, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Absolutely, the machines are encroaching on this space,&#8221; and what it forces us to reckon with is, &#8220;Well, why are we doing this? What are&#8230;&#8221; Because the what and how are going to continue to get automated, they&#8217;re going to continue to get more efficient, a lot of this stuff, again, just a whole bunch of UI just doesn&#8217;t need to be made straight up, AI or no AI, back to just design systems in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it&#8217;s like this, &#8220;Well, what do you mean I don&#8217;t need to build these forms from scratch?&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, get used to that because this is becoming more of a commodity. This is becoming more of&#8230;&#8221; The what and how, all artistry aside, and it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s not meant to diminish the craft of it, in the same way that a lot of people can spend their lives. I know knife makers, for instance, that forge things by hand, and it&#8217;s like it truly is, it&#8217;s a craft, it&#8217;s a gift, it&#8217;s a talent, but it&#8217;s also not how most people get their knives, we&#8217;ll say. They get their knives from a machine that splat out a thousand knives in an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just like we could talk about, I think, the societal impact of that, and I think that that actually is an important topic, and I&#8217;m happy to go there, but it&#8217;s just coming back to, &#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re a designer or developer or whatever.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;You really do have to come to terms with the fact that these things are going to encroach on it.&#8221; So, I&#8217;d encourage people not to be too precious about the what and the how, and instead use this opportunity to really, exactly like you said, the do that soul searching, go, &#8220;Well, why am I doing this? Why are we making the things we&#8217;re making?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That human-guided process of it&#8217;s just like, &#8220;How do we create something that is successful but also thoughtful, ethical, accessible?&#8221; All of that stuff, user- centric. It&#8217;s like that stuff is harder to automate, and I think that there&#8217;s going to be areas of that that are impacted or at least guided in part by the machines, but at the same time, it really does force an identity crisis that I actually don&#8217;t necessarily think is a bad thing. So, I guess, that would be my piece of advice is just like notice the discomfort that comes with it. If you feel threatened by this, really explore why that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s like brass tacks level, I think that that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. But, again, this bigger picture, I think, really does pretty immediately go into things like, &#8220;What do people do for work? How do we define value in society? How do we decouple people&#8217;s productive output?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, what are you doing with your hands.&#8221; Versus like your ability to live in a house with heating and cooling and things like that and be able to feed your family. I think that those types of things are absolutely the conversations we should be having, and this is, by the way, this is nothing particularly new, meaning that the industrial revolution really kicked off these same conversations where, &#8220;Oh yeah, you don&#8217;t need 700 people in a field harvesting wheat. You have a machine that can now blast through that in a couple hours. What do you do with those 700 people?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that we have grown whole new levels, a managerial class, a bunch of bureaucratic work, a bunch of other work. We have kept apace in this machine age, but as this information age is really taking root and now is being totally gasoline on a fire with this AI stuff, I think these conversations around things like universal basic income and things like that; these are becoming not some far future things, and are increasingly happening now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;re fewer cashiers that at supermarket checkout line and all of that. We do need to talk about labor, we do need to talk about worth, and in my view, it really does come back to respect, which is around how do we not just create more drudgery for people because we need to give them some money so that they could feed their families? How do we just make a more respectful society that honors people&#8217;s time and talents and ability and frees people up and doesn&#8217;t force them to be working seven jobs? If the machines can alleviate that, then we should do that, but we also should make sure that people don&#8217;t starve as a result. So, it&#8217;s really fascinating and gets into some pretty existential stuff pretty quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>No, it is, and I&#8217;m really happy that you are going in there, because these are the conversation to be had, these are the conversation that are not easy to have, because then all of a sudden you talk about what is fairness? What is purpose? What is equity? These are the conversation that we need to have, and if we close our eyes to it, because we have had experience in the history of humanity with a system that try to create a equal environment for everyone, and it&#8217;s called communism, and it didn&#8217;t end well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah, nice in theory. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Yeah. So, if we close our eyes to this topic, and not openly talk about it, we might put ourself in a position that we have to make fast, abrupt decision about how we should work together or live together, and end up coming up with suboptimal super bureaucratic systems that don&#8217;t benefit no one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah. Yep. That&#8217;s exactly right, and that by the way, is what we ought to be dedicating more of our brains space to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar: </strong>A hundred percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>As people are&#8230; You consider yourself a product designer, developer or something like that, it&#8217;s like that there&#8217;s a design problem for you. I&#8217;m not saying&#8230; But, it does, I think, all of this, yeah sure, having good e-commerce sites, and sure, having&#8230; There&#8217;s still going to be that stuff. I think that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of opportunity and employment and stuff like that in these worlds. But, I do come back to the, &#8220;What does it look like if&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;ll just use one example, date picker. Date picker is what I see as one of the most disrespectful-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar: </strong>Agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>&#8230; obnoxious, terrible things that literally if you think, the world over, millions, upon millions, upon millions of hours of human beings&#8217; time is spent designing, building, debugging, testing, maintaining these stupid things that should be standardized. There actually is a standard for it, but it&#8217;s because its current implementation is just a little subpar, you have millions upon millions upon millions of peoples&#8217; labor, the world over, doing that, and that is not a respectful use, that is not a healthy use of human beings&#8217; time and potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t see design systems are going to solve the world&#8217;s problems. But, I do think it does really boil down to, &#8220;What are we doing? Why are we doing this? Is this a good use of time and energy and resources? How do we make the most of our limited time on earth, individually and collectively, to make things better?&#8221; I think that kind of clutching pearls and saying, &#8220;But, don&#8217;t take away my rectangular drawing.&#8221; Is kind of a thing that&#8217;s, again, I think, worth examining and exploring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I think so too. Today I was reading, I&#8217;m trying to catch up with this AI revolution, this we are experiencing. I was reflecting earlier, Brad, that ChatGPT got introduced in end of November last year. Now, we got this ChatGPT-4, and this morning, I was looking up on my Twitter, and there was demo of it. The gentleman drew a simple website on his paper, and then, I don&#8217;t know, scanned it even through Slack, and then ChatGPT output was a simple website. It wasn&#8217;t a breakthrough website. It wasn&#8217;t like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to use this website.&#8221; But, it was a simple website that you could start to build, design, add to it, and finalize it, and that&#8217;s a first version of it. Folks don&#8217;t understand that, whenever I talk to folks, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh no, that&#8217;s so easy. That&#8217;s simple.&#8221; But, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s the first version. Wait for two months and see what happens to it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I saw this, and I saw another post, and I want to pick your brain on this that another folks on Twitter said, &#8220;The future of design work will be centering around developing design system, one part, and another part would be service design.&#8221; Like, &#8220;Why are we doing this?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost: </strong>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Right? What&#8217;s your take on this? What&#8217;s your reaction on this sort of a good tweet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah, I think I agree with that, in large part. I think that how interfaces and products come into being is going to increasingly be encroached upon. I think that it&#8217;s important and imperative for what those things are built with to be thoughtfully crafted and whatever. Now, again, I think that there&#8217;s going to be some automation and efficiencies gained even in that, just by default making things more accessible and whatever. I think that there&#8217;s a lot of just really rote things that can and should be automated and improved, and so even in the design system kind of creation world, I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s fully protected from all of this, but certainly, yeah, the ability to draw a little whiteboard sketch and have that turn into a real thing? My God, yeah, by the end of this year, a hundred percent we&#8217;re going to have some pretty sophisticated ways of doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you think about, and you best believe that Squarespace and Wix and the rest of them are able to just graph that on. I do see it as these layers similar to, &#8220;Okay, I help organizations create design systems. Those ought to be thoughtful.&#8221; But, then how you wield those, yeah, it becomes a tool. It becomes a really quick, and I would presume, a increasingly effective way of not just creating pie in the sky prototypes, but actually getting this stuff over the line and into the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah. But, coming back to the service design part of your question is I think these things can&#8217;t be trusted on their own as we&#8217;ve seen already, even as they improve. I think that it&#8217;s important to have the discernment to be able to say, &#8220;Is that good design? Is this a good user experience? Is this good service? Are these actually sound features? Do these things need tweak?&#8221; So, in a lot of cases, the mechanics of the construction of this can be automated left and right, but there still needs to be this very human, again, &#8220;Is this ethical? Is this accessible? Is this sound to design?&#8221; and I think that there always needs to be that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like humans giving a humanity check to what&#8217;s being produced, because otherwise it&#8217;s just in the same way that some of the AI generated images and stuff like that are seemingly nonsensical. We need to have that human eye to make sure that things actually make sense, that they&#8217;re actually useful. So, that&#8217;s what&#8230; I don&#8217;t see it as a one or the other kind of thing. Yeah, I see it as the machines are going to just eat through the stuff that are pretty standard, fair, and boiler plate, and repetitious, and whatever, and that should be welcome, again, just like going through and having to do these chores is just not fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we should welcome that, we should embrace that, but it does mean that we need to really start exercising the muscles that, again, focus on the why, that get into good UI/UX, product design, service design, development, all of that stuff, the meaty fundamentals that we all ought to be focused on. But, I think a lot of people are a little bit more distracted by the rectangle drawing. So, it&#8217;s like now&#8217;s the time to beef up the fundamentals, as I see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I will say that those folks that really try to understand this new revolution and try to ride it very well, they can really use this massive, massive, massive tools at their disposal, to pimp up their design outputs, the quality of what the&#8230; Because, as if when we get to a point, I don&#8217;t know when, tomorrow, next month, two months from now, three months from now, six months from now, that you can interact with ChatGPT visually, and then you say that, &#8220;Hey, ChatGPT, I have this idea in mind for this login screen. I don&#8217;t know. I want to like give me 20 different options with these kind of styles. Give it to me, and has a plugin to Figma, and get all those options into Figma,&#8221; and then that would be the starting point of your design process, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost: </strong>Yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar: </strong>Oh my goodness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yep. &#8220;Show me these different things. Show one that&#8217;s left align, center align, right align. Show one with a button group that says this versus that. Show me one with single sign-on option. Show me this with a dark background versus a light background,&#8221; and you just have that happen literally automatically, it&#8217;s in seconds. Again, all you need to do is look at the power behind the Stable Diffusions and the DALL-Es and all of these just really robust things. They&#8217;re painting entire universes, these fantastical just like&#8230; It&#8217;s like when you just, coming back to bootstrap, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Man, oh man, that stuff is just so common and so easy, that AI&#8217;s just going to like&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m sure that there&#8217;s a bunch of people on the planet right now doing exactly this, figuring out the most easy and efficient way to make it happen. So, it&#8217;s not that far of a cry to predict that, yeah, by the end of the year, there&#8217;s probably going to be some pretty viable players that at least can get teams pretty far down the road, like you&#8217;re saying. It&#8217;s a tool that becomes part of the toolkit versus you&#8217;re totally out of a job, but it does just, again, force us into a more thoughtful intellectual realm compared to just a production house. So, I think it&#8217;s inevitable. It&#8217;s pretty wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I can&#8217;t help but just immediately going back, it&#8217;s like we work with a bunch of organizations, a lot of organizations have a lot of offshore teams, a lot of that stuff, I get really, I think, concern, that is the word for sure, because our society and how we go about putting value on things and skills and whatever, entire economies, are built up around, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re just going to farm these chores out to places,&#8221; and, &#8220;Oh, we have all of these engineers in this country,&#8221; and if you have the machines coming in to rip through that stuff in a matter of minutes, what the hell does that do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar: </strong>Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>It&#8217;s bad. So, again, I think the urgency around figuring out&#8230; I treat this as inevitable. I think that the trajectory it&#8217;s on, but I think it is up to all of us to really have the conversations that are more political, more societal in nature, that basically start to raise the flag of, &#8220;Hey, this is coming at a really fast clip and is going to disrupt entire industries that have been growth sectors for a very, very long time, and that felt really sound bets.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and then of course there&#8217;s the power dynamics of these things, which is to say the people who do get the equation right are going to wield massive amounts of power, and how do you have checks and balances? How do you regulate or temper that stuff with some thoughtfulness and humanity? That stuff worries me a fair amount because I think that there aren&#8217;t proper safeguards, and we&#8217;ve been doing nothing, at least in the States, but deregulating a lot of things with disastrous consequences. So, there&#8217;s not a lot of precedent for this; people aren&#8217;t even getting their heads around what this stuff even is, and it&#8217;s just going to blindside everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I think so. I think I don&#8217;t want to be negative about this, and I really admire that you are trying to look at it from a standpoint of a designer. I get it. For a lot of executive folks that are listening to this is like, &#8220;I feel like Brad is doing his best to stay really practical and look at the topic from the designer standpoint, not a political standpoint,&#8221; because it&#8217;s easy to be political, and often when you get political, you focus on the problem so much, and you don&#8217;t offer solutions, and we don&#8217;t want to be like that, we want to be designers and offer solution. But, I really agree with you is the pace is such a fast pace that we will be surprised, as a society, in the US, in the Europe, we will be surprised and there will be a point that we are like, &#8220;Oh my goodness, what if we had thought about this few years back?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost: </strong>Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Right? I think then, when we hit to that point, then the question here is, &#8220;How fast are we going to be to course correct and come up with a set of regulations, set of measures that ensure that our economic engines move forward in a way that doesn&#8217;t leave people behind?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah. Yeah, I think that that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s like that trajectory, again, I see it as inevitable. So, it really does all fall squarely on how are we going to collectively react to it, and it&#8217;s interesting, and it&#8217;s not something that is like, one, you can&#8217;t put this genie back in the bottle, I think. You can&#8217;t just shut it down and say, &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to do it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t even know if there&#8217;s really a way to pump the brakes on it even. It&#8217;s not like you could slow the rollout of it or anything like that. It&#8217;s kind of on its own path. But, I do think that, again, I can&#8217;t help but keep coming back to, it&#8217;s just like it really is forcing our hand into thinking of just, &#8220;What do we value as a society? How do we make sure that people are taken care of when, yeah, a bunch of jobs are going to evaporate overnight?&#8221; It&#8217;s wild. It&#8217;s wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, I don&#8217;t know. It is, I think, important to have nuanced conversations about-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar: </strong>Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>&#8230; all of this, because it&#8217;s like&#8230; This is what I think really concerns me with a lot of the discourse around it, as well as coming from the creators of these things themselves, where, like good technologists, and like whatever, they&#8217;re excited, they&#8217;re seeing this world through rose colored glasses, and I think one of the biggest design principles that every designer working on the planet right now, people building stuff, should be asking the question, again, AI, no AI, is like, &#8220;What harm can people do with this thing? With the thing that I&#8217;m creating, how can somebody use that to do harm?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that is a universal design principle that ought to be on the front of everyone&#8217;s mind whenever they&#8217;re making things, whether that&#8217;s banking software, whether that&#8217;s a design tool, whether that&#8217;s chatbot, whether that&#8217;s an AI tool, whether that&#8217;s like just this user interface that we&#8217;re interacting through. All of that needs to be a front of mind consideration, and I think that that&#8217;s the thing that I see as the most troubling, where it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s just some real clear risks to this stuff, and I see the people who are producing it trying to diminish it, and it&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t need to diminish it, because we get the value of it, there&#8217;s so much good that can come from it, but you also just need to be frank and honest and upfront and really own the potential downsides of it, because they&#8217;re there, and pretending like they&#8217;re not there isn&#8217;t going to make them not exist, it&#8217;s just going to make you look foolish when things ultimately go wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it&#8217;s just, I think, we need to have honest and open and nuanced conversations about all of this, and to not villainize it or demonize it or say like, &#8220;This is a savior.&#8221; It&#8217;s like reality is always more complicated than that, especially with stuff that&#8217;s this powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I think so too, and I think ever increasing&#8230; I think, first of all, I mean, just to be really candid is like us designers, we don&#8217;t have to stay in our field me, we might need to, for example, level up and get more involved in the design of processes, in the way how government works or how some of our societal structures work. There&#8217;s increasing need for service designers, there&#8217;s increasing need of researchers to understand the complexity of our socio-technological environment. Yeah, it&#8217;s ever increasingly what I&#8217;m lacking, and that when I look at the conversation on Twitter, or sometimes on YouTube, is that I think we need to have, I&#8217;ve said it before, we need to have people with a open mindset, people who are philosophically open, because there is no&#8230; For me, us designers, it&#8217;s very clear, everything is in gray area, there is no black and white. There is sometimes blacks and there is sometimes white, but most of the time it&#8217;s gray. But, I think that level of openness is not widespread in society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>I think so. I think that a lot of the media channels and the media environment have the affordances of those platforms, of tools like Twitter and things like that, have proven to be pretty divisive, right? And the Facebooks and the Twitters and everything, and the YouTubes, where it&#8217;s just like the stuff that is incendiary and hyperbolic gets the views, gets the eyeballs, and that encourages people to devolve into these black and white camps, and that&#8217;s a shame because they don&#8217;t have to be, and that&#8217;s where, yeah, the word &#8220;nuance&#8221; is just one of the things that I am starving for. Literally any topic of conversation could benefit from more nuance, and just like you said, open, honest, coming at it from a point of curiosity, coming at it from a point of really trying to genuinely understand, versus trying to form an opinion about something and then go to the mat defending it, it&#8217;s just like it&#8217;s not productive, it&#8217;s not helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar: </strong>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>I do think, you&#8217;re absolutely right, that designers are pretty well positioned to model that behavior, and I see it in our work with organizations. It&#8217;s like to help other folks understand, executives to understand a product, people to understand, more like IT people to understand, to have designers kind of come in and ask questions, not in a threatening or finger pointing way, but really to help unpack, &#8220;What are we doing here? How could we be doing this better?&#8221; And opening the door to collaboration, to arrive at some things that people feel good about, that is, &#8220;Oh, this will be good for our customers, this will be good for our users, this will be good for people, but this will also be good for our business and stuff.&#8221; It&#8217;s like we need to be doing that exact process in many, many different realms. Yeah. So, the urgency of all of this, I think, is something that&#8217;s becoming increasingly apparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Brad, we&#8217;ve been talking a lot on the bird&#8217;s eye view. I think it happens when you have two folks like us in one conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah, they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Yeah, I do. I&#8217;m really aware of the time as well. I&#8217;ve been really trying to have this tough conversation with you for 60 minutes. You might, I mean, cognitively, in a position, that you might need to have some rest. I would like to get your brain on this. A good portion of our listeners are up and coming designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost: </strong>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Right? I feel like entering the product design world is getting trickier than ever, especially after this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>You may want to reconsider your decision to enter this field *laughs*</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I would like to get your two cents on it, and I don&#8217;t expect you to have a clean answer on this. So, for the last few minutes, what&#8217;s your two cents words of advice to younger designers who sort of started or who&#8217;d like to start enter the space? Take it away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Yeah. I think what we&#8217;ve been talking about is still really relevant, and I&#8217;d say that my advice to really any young person, period, but young product designer, is I think really understanding, &#8220;Why you are attracted to this field?&#8221; To understand at a really soul level, &#8220;What is it that you enjoy doing, and why do you enjoy doing those things?&#8221; For me, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve always loved a good puzzle, a good jigsaw puzzle. I like creating things, and it&#8217;s just like that&#8217;s the instincts that I have. It&#8217;s just those tendencies or notions, and I think it&#8217;s really important to know thyself, as they say, in order to apply yourself in any role, because, as we&#8217;ve been talking about, this landscape changes all the time, whenever we started in this field, the tools were totally different, the processes were half-baked or non-existent, yet all of this stuff is going to keep changing, and that&#8217;s good, and just acknowledge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what do you do when it&#8217;s hard to grasp onto something that&#8217;s moving so quickly? I think that the first answer is, again, to go inward and to really understand yourself, what you&#8217;re attracted to, what types of things you like applying to do, and that&#8217;s going to serve you really well, because all you need to do is look at some of the worldwide stats around&#8230; We no longer work in a world where you work for a company for 35, 40 years and retire with a gold watch, you&#8217;re going to probably change jobs a bunch of times, you&#8217;re probably going to change careers at least once, just statistically speaking. So, it&#8217;s so incredibly important to carry yourself with an understanding of what your talents, your ability, your potential is, and what your tendencies are, what you like doing and what you don&#8217;t like doing. To do more of the things that you like, and less of the things you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that simple. Do what you like, do more of that, and all the while, when you find things that you don&#8217;t like, figure out ways to do less of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How that plays out in a product design world, especially in your early days, you&#8217;re going to be confronted with a bunch of things. You&#8217;re getting your foot in the door, you&#8217;re going to be exposed to certain tools, you&#8217;re going to be building certain things, you&#8217;re going to be playing around with different things. Maybe you&#8217;re doing user research, maybe you&#8217;re doing interviews, maybe you&#8217;re doing wire frames, maybe you&#8217;re doing all sorts of things, front-end development, maybe you&#8217;re restarting the router whenever it goes down, and you&#8217;re figuring out how to do different things. I think it&#8217;s important to be open to the possibility that you can get set on a path that is wildly different than what you have in mind now, and that that&#8217;s true for many, many, many, many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, again, keep an open mind, keep that curiosity, figure out of the activities that you end up doing professionally or just even in your school, say, &#8220;Ooh, I like this. I want more of this. I&#8217;m curious about this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Ooh, this doesn&#8217;t sit right with me.&#8221; When those things happen, notice, say, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t sit right with me, and this is a chore, and I never wanted to do it again.&#8221; Or, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t sit right with me. Maybe I should stick with it a little bit longer because it&#8217;s important.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s important to discern, &#8220;Is this an uncomfortable thing or something that I just absolutely hate?&#8221; Or, &#8220;This is important enough where I need to power through for at least a little while.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, just notice those ebbs and flows in your trajectory. &#8220;I like this tool. I like this activity. I like working in this way. I like working, building new stuff, versus maintaining existing stuff.&#8221; There&#8217;s so many different dichotomies that are out there, and you just have to keep that self-reflection going. You have to keep every single day going, &#8220;How do I do more of what I want to do and less of what I don&#8217;t want to do?&#8221; And know that the environment&#8217;s still going to change, and next year&#8217;s landscape is going to look different than this year&#8217;s landscape, and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think that that&#8217;s really my biggest piece of advice. But, also coming back to what we were talking about earlier, I do think that there are more fundamentals. We tend to have an infatuation with tools. I&#8217;m a front-end developer by trade, and just different frameworks and different tools. I was listening in on an online conference yesterday, and it was just so funny as somebody that&#8217;s like, &#8220;I am a developer, but I&#8217;m not that far in,&#8221; and just the list of buzzwords and product names and package names and project names. It was almost comical to me, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;I know that that list next year is going to be totally different, or at least not the same.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s important to just recognize that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is is that you&#8217;ll be hired to do something, and you&#8217;ll need to use the tools that are available and the processes and whatever. You&#8217;re going to work using some of the real stuff, but at the same time, you really need to be working on establish that foundation that is more conceptual, that is more evergreen, that is more just kind of like that stuff is tried and true, good foundational concepts, good usability principles, good human-centric design, good accessibility. Just those types of foundations are going to survive and transcend the kind of flavor of the month that you&#8217;ll be working in from project to project along your career path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>I cannot thank you enough. This has been one of the most relevant conversation I&#8217;ve had in the past six months, and I&#8217;m filled with honor. Thank you a lot, Brad, for being really open, being really candid. I think a lot of&#8230; You walk the fine line and try to touch upon really some important topics that some folks avoid to talk about. So, I really appreciate that you went there. I appreciate that you came on the podcast, being so kind enough. Folks, that was it. I knew, I told you this is going to be a really remarkable podcast. I hope you get something out of it. I opened my eyes to a lot of new topics. Thanks, Brad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>Hey, thank you so much for having me, and for having, I think, an important and relevant conversation. So, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s been really great to be able to express this stuff and have an outlet for it, because that&#8217;s been pretty front of mind for me for a while, so I really appreciate the opportunity to chat about it with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Yeah, I&#8217;ll make sure that it&#8217;s going to go live next week. That&#8217;s because we have a long queue for the episodes, but I&#8217;ll put it on top of the list because I think a lot of designers would benefit from listening this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brad Frost:</strong><br>That&#8217;s great. Awesome. Well, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behrad Mirafshar:</strong><br>Thank you, folks. Until next episode. Ciao.</p>\n",

I love it and love having documentation of the things I&#8217;ve done, feelings I&#8217;ve felt, experiences I&#8217;ve had, etc. I just haven&#8217;t built the habit yet. I&#8217;d like to change that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I want to document my life moving forward, I also want to start painting a coherent picture of my past. As certain memories pop into my consciousness, I want to be able to capture them and place them in the appropriate chronology. While I&#8217;m aware that my <a href=\"https://lindagraham-mft.net/the-experiencing-self-vs-the-remembering-self/\">remembering self</a> will no doubt skew any documentation of my past, it&#8217;s better than not having any documentation at all!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, I&#8217;m using Notion for the task at hand. Right now my setup looks a little something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"550\" height=\"1078\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CleanShot-2023-03-29-at-16.06.05@2x.png\" alt=\"A Notion sidebar with title &quot;Journal&quot; and a tree navigation with items featuring different milestones from Brad's life, such as &quot;Early Childhood&quot;, &quot;College&quot;, &quot;NYC&quot;, and so on.\" class=\"wp-image-16927\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CleanShot-2023-03-29-at-16.06.05@2x.png 550w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CleanShot-2023-03-29-at-16.06.05@2x-522x1024.png 522w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is largely scaffolding at the present moment, but there are a few nuggets and some fleshed-out memories peppered throughout. It&#8217;s been a successful experiment so far, but there&#8217;s a long way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Capturing Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Music has been a big part of my life, and I want to give special attention. I&#8217;d love to be able to tell a comprehensive story of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What music I listen to</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What music I see live</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What music I make </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For music I listen to, I&#8217;m thankful for <a href=\"https://last.fm\">Last.fm</a> holding down the fort and <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/user/brad_frost\">faithfully tracking my music listening</a> for the last 15 years. I&#8217;m happy to continue leaning on that, and potentially using that data to display something on my own website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For documenting live music, I desperately want to steal the brilliant <a href=\"https://robweychert.com/\">Rob Weychert</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://tinnitus.robweychert.com/\">Tinnitus Tracker project</a>, which is his way of documenting his live music adventures. So Rob, I hope it&#8217;s alright if I end up stealing this idea and retroactively retracing the concerts I&#8217;ve attended over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capturing all the music I&#8217;ve <em>created</em> is a trickier one. I have so many sketches, noodles, jam sessions, demos, recorded tracks, and drum covers that are scattered across hard drives, voice memos, and online services. I have ideas for how to pull all of this together but it&#8217;ll be a big undertaking. For now, I&#8217;m looking to lean on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/frostfrost-1\">my SoundCloud</a> (for audio only) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuakNy-c-pG3rlrGyLzFPgA\">my YouTube channel</a> (for video + audio) to round up and share my musical creations. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retracing my life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is absolutely necessary for me to live my life. But I think retracing my life and filling in the gaps is helpful for understanding myself, gaining insights, and giving my daughter and potential descendants a window into my life. Life life itself, this exercise is going to be a journey!</p>\n",

But in my experience, too much thinking leads to overthinking. I always seem to get caught up in how much time and effort a thing is going to take, and that I&#8217;ll need to do a ton of preparation, and I&#8217;ll need to have things just right, and on and on. That thinking does nothing but talk me out of doing creative work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But! I&#8217;ve been working on noticing myself cycling over things too much, <strong>and have made a deliberate effort to try to quickly translate the excitement of an idea into into an actual reality. </strong>I see this as a new muscle I&#8217;ve just discovered and am excited to start building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So if you have an idea you keep coming back to in your head, just do it. </strong></p>\n",

I had the realization that my little drive home is a nice window of time to share my thoughts, so I&#8217;m exploring what that might look like! This feels like a fun and natural thing to try out, and I&#8217;d welcome any thoughts and feedback on this new experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I woke up this morning with AI on my mind, and a quick glance at my Twitter feed made it clear that it&#8217;s on a lot of other people&#8217;s minds as well. So I used my little commute to explore the topic of AI&#8217;s potential impact on the world of digital design and development. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"AI&#039;s impact on digital design and development\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_NroPk7d_g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the (cleaned up) transcript: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey there, this is Brad Frost, and this is a brand new thing called &#8220;I&#8217;m a dad that just dropped his daughter off at school, and I have about a 10-12 minute commute back to my home and about to plug in in my office&#8221;. But I was like, &#8220;Man, 12 minutes is kind of a good amount of time to be able to dig into something. I&#8217;ve been desperately wanting to share more. And thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/literally-no-one-calls-me-that-or-has-ever-called-me-t-1819592848\">Ol&#8217; Musky</a> Twitter situation, I&#8217;m finding myself going, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;d like to operate in maybe some other spaces, but also my brain moves a lot faster than my fingers. So I&#8217;d love to kind of have this time to be able to share things of interest to me: professionally, personally, talking about web design and development, talking about creativity, talking about art, design, music, mental health, wellbeing, spirituality, and other consequential matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wake up in the morning with a bunch of things on my mind and, and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;You know what? Maybe I should do this.&#8221; I promise I&#8217;m being safe. I am not looking at the camera. I&#8217;m keeping my eyes on the road. It&#8217;s a pretty straight shot from my daughter&#8217;s school home, so hopefully I could walk and chew gum at the same time. So anyways, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m gonna do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To kick things off, I woke up this morning with AI on my mind.</strong> I actually was interviewed for a podcast yesterday where we got into that a fair amount. And so I want to pick up on that. This podcast is gonna be published I think next week, which I&#8217;ll definitely make sure to share whenever it comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of [the podcast] was talking about how AI is going to impact the world of web design and development, design and development in general, and some of the really big cultural and societal ramifications of this technology. And I woke up this morning and naturally checked my feeds, and I feel like every other tweet was about GPT4 and all of these really fast-paced, breakneck-speed improvements to these technologies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I feel like I&#8217;m pretty measured when it comes to technology. You know, I&#8217;ve seen tons of trends come and go, things like blockchain and web3 stuff. It&#8217;s a &#8220;there it is and there it goes&#8221; kind of thing. I&#8217;ve always kind of been more foundational in my thinking as far as what I feel are important  technologies. I still think that betting on the web is a good bet, and there&#8217;s a lot of other technologies and things that come and go that just kind of haven&#8217;t stood the test of time. This, to me, AI really does feel like the first thing that has really made me go, &#8220;Oh yeah, this is it. This, this absolutely is going to change the very nature of the work we do.&#8221; <strong>And I am simultaneously excited and concerned about it. And I think that it&#8217;s important to be able to hold both of those thoughts in your head at the same time, because like most things it requires a lot of nuance.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We need to be talking about the good and the bad in an open and honest way.</strong> And so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to do here is just pick at that a little bit. So I wrote a post about how <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-in-the-time-of-ai/\">design systems might be impacted by the world of AI</a> and the most commonsensical and easy use case is that you are able to take a whiteboard sketch of an interface and kind of teach AI to learn your component library and basically take that sketch and turn it into a real thing. And sure enough, just this morning I saw somebody <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/1636327907936071680\">do exactly that</a>, right? They took a little picture of a sketch of the webpage and it splat out some markup and and styles and whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and that&#8217;s that. I think that that&#8217;s amazing. I think that&#8217;s genuinely amazing and it gets really to the heart of what it is we do and how we do it. And I think that it&#8217;s inevitable. I think that it&#8217;s a matter of time. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be mature and integrated and implemented in large organizations around the world like next month. But next year? Certainly in five years. So <strong>when we talk about what we&#8217;re doing with all of this, I think it&#8217;s increasingly important to decouple the <em>what</em> and the <em>how</em> of how we go about creating digital products from the <em>why</em> and making sure that it is sound.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that those are, those are little kind of different equations. <strong>I think that the <em>what</em> and the <em>how</em> are going to continue to be just eaten away at by AI but also just efficiencies in general</strong>. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in the world of design systems, and that&#8217;s kind of an express goal, right? It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, you don&#8217;t have to go and create that card for the 17th time. You don&#8217;t have to build that button from the ground up. You don&#8217;t need to hand craft every piece of  markup or hand draw three versions of the same design comp in Figma.&#8221; That&#8217;s waste. That&#8217;s not a respectful use of people&#8217;s time. So design systems are about efficiency, and we&#8217;re all trying to become more efficient, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there&#8217;s a lot of like, Taylorism, industrialism, blah blah blah; I&#8217;ve seen a lot of commentary and I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-agile-and-industrialization/\">commented on that myself</a>, like where you could kind of get into the capitalist wheels of it. But let&#8217;s get at it from like a really bedrock level. We want to make great digital things and we would like to do that as quickly as possible. I would say to the people who are pushing back against that, let&#8217;s maybe challenge that a little bit because he thing that&#8217;s important when it comes to increased efficiency is that there&#8217;s  there&#8217;s the risk of reduced quality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that this is going to be kind of a big shift in our field, a big shift in our industry. <strong>If the means of production for creating digital products are increasingly assisted or led or maybe even taken over completely by artificial intelligence, I think that the role of the designer and developer kind of becomes one of quality control</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I see design and development stratifying into the beginning of the process, meaning you&#8217;re on the creation end of these processes.</strong> <strong>You are the ones crafting the design systems and making sure that the raw materials of these tools that AI wield.</strong> I think that there&#8217;s still going to need to be a fair amount of human talent involved in and kind of making sure that the tools that we&#8217;re using to build these things out of are solid, are accessible, are performant, are resilient, are ethical, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And once those toolkits exist, then slapping them together and composing them I think are increasingly going to be handled by non-design, non-technical folks.</strong> And it already happens in the world of like CMSs and stuff. You have a bunch of marketers who wanna just splat out a hundred thousand different landing pages for things, and they don&#8217;t necessarily know how to design and develop, but they&#8217;re able to log into a CMS and spin up a new page and publish that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that trend is going to continue where you&#8217;re going to have a bunch of non-technical folks wielding AI saying, &#8220;You know, as a business stakeholder, I need this new website that has this hero unit that says this and calls to action and drives to this page, and then has a grid of three cards that have these three things that are featured there and go grab some of her product imagery from a database, and of course a header and a footer. Please generate that for me and wired up to the appropriate systems.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not that far of a cry to really envision that thatcan happen, and I think can happen quite easily. It&#8217;s really a matter of time, right? So I think that&#8217;s it.  So back to the stratification. <strong>There&#8217;s the people who will focus on the creation of the raw materials that then get assembled in myriad ways.</strong> And then I think that <strong>there&#8217;s the other end of it, which is, &#8220;Okay, some marketer plus AI just came up with a brand new thing, and now we really need to validate it and make sure that it is not <em>evil</em> to make sure it&#8217;s ethical first and foremost&#8221; That it&#8217;s not garbage, right?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we make sure that these things are built properly and soundly, are accessible, are performant, are doing all the things so effectively, <strong>many hands I think will need to become more brains that are checking against what this AI-assisted or AI-led work is doing</strong>. <strong>So there are these bookends of people creating things that will get used in a bunch of ways, and then people on the other end that really serve as a safety &amp; sanity check and as a QA check for the stuff that gets produced with it.</strong> And I think that&#8217;s not that far away. I think that all the building blocks are here at present to make this happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially in the word of like digital interfaces. We&#8217;re not talking about anything particularly exciting: it&#8217;s forms, it&#8217;s marketing sites, it&#8217;s dashboards. A lot of your standard fare interfaces are not the most wowee-zowee, doing triple back flips. They&#8217;re just kind of helping people along the flow or whatever. So I see that as an inevitability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve talked about the pros, which are, &#8220;Okay, this is efficient.&#8221; And you can go from like a concept to (with that human guidance) something that is a sound digital product coming out the other end. And rather than taking months and months, it might take weeks or days or hours or or seconds, who the hell knows? And again, that&#8217;s inevitable. I see that as something that we should be actively encouraging at the expense of other things, namely quality and just basic ethical judgment. But I think that that&#8217;s the trajectory it&#8217;s on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The downsides of all of this are obviously massive.</strong> I can&#8217;t help but think about the entire economies that are built on basically farming out a lot of rote development tasks or design tasks, just like feature factory kind of churn. We work with a whole slew of organizations that employ many different-shaped sizes and flavors of offshore development. But also a lot of not even offshore, like a lot of teams are effectively doing this kind of composition work today, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are the ones saying, &#8220;Okay, well, I need to put this homepage together. I&#8217;m taking these pieces, I&#8217;m stitching them together, I&#8217;m wiring them up to some backend system.&#8221; <strong>And I think that means of production becoming more efficient and more led, or at least guided by AI is a real genuine existential threat to large swaths of people producing digital work. And that&#8217;s terrifying.</strong> That&#8217;s utterly and completely terrifying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I think that what is terrifying about it is that we don&#8217;t have the social structures in place</strong>, certainly not in America, where human value is so coupled to the amount of work that we produce. That work is being encroached upon by AI much in the same way that self-checkouts at grocery stores and driverless cars [are encroaching on jobs]. (Actually, forget about driverless cars; that&#8217;s still a little bit of like a future thing.) But self checkouts at grocery stores is a great example of &#8220;here is this thing that used to require a bunch of humans to make this thing go.&#8221; And now machines take care of that and it seems to be working. A lot of people prefer it, and that means that there are fewer jobs for cashiers. And we used to think as knowledge workers that we were exempt from all of that, but here comes these things that are just totally going to eat our lunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going all the way back to the Industrial Revolution and what that was supposed to unlock for us, which was we just would have more time. We&#8217;d have leisure, we have the means of economic production,  the machines and now the computers churning along and producing value, and we just get to kick our feet up and live happier, more fulfilling lives, not focused on drawing rectangles or sitting behind a till at a grocery store dealing with irate people all day. And that&#8217;s great and that is the ideal, but we are not set up as a society for that. Politically we are like worlds away from that, again speaking from an American perspective here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And  I think that&#8217;s the biggest risk because at the end of the day, if we were just able to snap our fingers and create a bunch of sites and apps and have those things work and make information more easily accessible and build new things for us, that can be great. And again we get to kick our feet up with a light beer and just spend time with our families. That&#8217;s great, but <strong>so long as our ability to feed our families and pay our rent and pay for healthcare is tied to what we do for work, [AI encroaching on work] is just a gigantic and huge and urgent threat to a lot of people&#8217;s wellbeing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, I&#8217;m coming at this from the lens of design and development, but we&#8217;re talking about entire industries just being totally upended seemingly overnight, certainly faster than the wheels of society move. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyways, pros: we get more efficient ways of doing things. We get to take some of the rote and repetitious and — I don&#8217;t want to say thoughtless — but less intellectually-challenging work off of our hands, where we are able to just stitch these things together and spin them up faster and do all of that. Cons: I think that there&#8217;s a lot of risk that a lot of people&#8217;s jobs are going to be impacted by this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, then there&#8217;s just also the more existential stuff around AI in general, around what value system is AI operating by? What are its blind spots anddo we even like know where these things are are going or how they even work? I think that [those questions] are really important, and there are far smarter people than me that are dealing with and talking about those things. <strong>But I think that the cons are many and the cons are massive</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I also think that in our discourse today, these things are being either vilified or deified, and we ought to be having real open and honest and nuanced conversations about all of this. These things aren&#8217;t going away; you can&#8217;t put these genies back in the bottle. So it really becomes a question of how we approach this in a very eyes wide open way to mitigate the risks and promote healthy use of this stuff</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do we do this in a way that balances the efficiency and the superpowers that the stuff can give us with a real humanity? How do we do this in a way that preserves the integrity of humanity and how do we not just use the efficiency to bulldoze and steamroll a lot of people&#8217;s livelihoods?</strong> And that&#8217;s especially for the people who have the authority and the ability to green light something like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. So these are things that are on my mind after dropping my daughter off at school and heading home to get to work. These are things that I just kick around in my brain all the time. Not all of them are this big and consequential; I&#8217;d like to talk about more fun stuff too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is an experiment. We&#8217;ll see if I keep at it. I would really welcome feedback and ideas around it. I would really love to have more of these types of conversations, and I&#8217;m exploring a bunch of different ways of making that happen, and I&#8217;m really excited about some things that are on the horizon. So here we go! I&#8217;d welcome your feedback on this. What should I be doing more of or less of? Or should you say, &#8220;Brad, stick to your lane&#8221; hahaha. All right. Hey, take care. I hope you have a fantastic day.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping to continue publishing stuff like this, so if you think this is interesting feel free to subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@brad_frost\">my YouTube channel</a> and <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/brad-frosts-blog\">my RSS feed</a>. </p>\n",

      "value": "\n<p>Once upon a time, I had the word &#8220;artist&#8221; in my bio. Somewhere along the line, I removed it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it was because I was preoccupied with what I do for money. Maybe it was because I&#8217;m not a professional artist. Maybe it was because my art isn&#8217;t particularly great from a technical perspective. Maybe it was because I don&#8217;t make art often enough to justify the label. Maybe I felt other labels (like musician) were sufficient. Maybe I was just overthinking it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am an artist. In my soul, I know that. It&#8217;s such a natural instinct for me to create things using artistic mediums. If money and responsibilities were taking out of the equation, it&#8217;s a safe bet I&#8217;d spend a great deal of my time creating art. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why my past decision to remove &#8220;artist&#8221; from my bio fascinates me. Why would I deny myself that label when it&#8217;s such a core part of who I am? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a interesting to witness my own growth and evolvution beyond standard conventions. Rather than questioning or challenging aspects of myself because they don&#8217;t fit into conventional boxes, I&#8217;m now questioning and challenging the boxes themselves. I am a multi-faceted individual with a plethora of gifts to offer, and I want to show up to all areas in my life as my whole self.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are all multi-faceted individuals with a plethora of gifts to offer, and I think we&#8217;d be better if we showed up to all areas of our lives as our whole selves.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps that I&#8217;m married to an artist who inspires me every day. While she suffers from the same doubts about owning the &#8220;artist&#8221; label, she is an artist at her core. In her soul. Look at any scrap of paper within her immediate vicinity and it becomes abundantly clear that she is an artist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve been through the wringer over the last number of years, which is why it&#8217;s been so incredibly welcome and important for us to get back into art making. We&#8217;ve been threatening to paint our piano since we moved into our house two years ago, and we finally did it!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PXL_20230314_151749128.MP_-700x933.jpg\" alt=\"A sky blue piano with cloud pattern painted on it.

As my life returns to normal, I&#8217;m already seeing big improvements in my ability to focus and make actual progress on actual things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But distractions still abound, and I find myself pulled away from the things I need to be doing. So I thought I&#8217;d share some tools that have proven to be helpful focus my attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hazeover</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"818\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-4.03.42-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16779\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-4.03.42-PM.png 818w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-4.03.42-PM-700x256.png 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-4.03.42-PM-768x281.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hazeover.com/\">Hazeover</a> dims out everything except the active window, which reduces visual clutter and keeps my eyeballs on the task at hand. While I don&#8217;t use it for coding (keeping my editor and browser side-by-side is important), it&#8217;s really helpful for other things, like writing this blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Focus</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"650\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-5.42.22-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16780\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using <strong><a href=\"https://heyfocus.com/\">Focus</a></strong> for years to block distracting websites and apps. I can control which sites and apps I want to block, and I can set a schedule for working hours so I don&#8217;t find myself putzing around on social media instead of getting things done. (Side note: managing social media use is incredibly hard for me because social media is both a distraction as well as a tremendous source of news, resources, inspiration, and community. It&#8217;s tough to put a binary switch on all that).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>RescueTime</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-5.43.15-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16781\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-5.43.15-PM.png 750w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-5.43.15-PM-700x433.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rescuetime.com/\">RescueTime</a> overlaps a bit with Focus in that it has a feature that can block out distractions. I use Focus out of habit, so I don&#8217;t use RescueTime&#8217;s focus tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But! RescueTime is easily some of the best money I spend all year. The tool captures what sites and apps you use, lets you flag them as &#8220;productive&#8221; or &#8220;distracting&#8221;, and creates beautiful reports on how you spend your time. They also have <a href=\"https://blog.rescuetime.com/\">a fantastic blog</a> (shoutout to Robin Copple) that in my view captures a really healthy and holistic view of productivity and wellbeing. Insights abound with RescueTime!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>xTab</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-1.54.19-PM-1024x554.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16788\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-1.54.19-PM-1024x554.png 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-1.54.19-PM-700x379.png 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-1.54.19-PM-768x416.png 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-1.54.19-PM-1536x831.png 1536w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-1.54.19-PM.png 1844w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xtab/amddgdnlkmohapieeekfknakgdnpbleb?hl=en\">xTab</a> is a Chrome extension that limits the number of open tabs you can have. I&#8217;m one of those people who ends up with 2px-wide browser tabs because I have 9583289 open. With xTab, I&#8217;m able to keep that bad habit under control. You can configure it to automatically close older tabs, or just yell at you that you can&#8217;t open any more (that&#8217;s what I set it to). When that happens (which is often), I&#8217;ll go through and decide what&#8217;s worth closing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Android Focus Mode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-8.22.52-AM-1024x621.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16783\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-8.22.52-AM-1024x621.png 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-8.22.52-AM-700x425.png 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-8.22.52-AM-768x466.png 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-8.22.52-AM-1536x932.png 1536w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-08-at-8.22.52-AM.png 2018w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On my phone I&#8217;m able to define working hours that disables distracting apps. Blocking out Twitter, Instagram, and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.os.space.force.galaxy.alien&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1\">Galaxiga</a> keeps me from getting sucked into the black hole of my phone. I&#8217;ve found a lot of value in all of Android&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/\">Digital Wellbeing</a> tools, and would love if it was more front and center in the operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plenty more where that came from</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m with it enough to know that tools alone won&#8217;t magically take me to a focused, productive nirvana. But also, tools can help keep the train on the tracks when my brain wants to do anything but. So with that in mind, I&#8217;d love to hear what tools, techniques, processes, etc you use to stay focused. </p>\n",

Yes, it&#8217;s all drywall, but it&#8217;s working with it in totally different ways!</p>\n",

This moment feels equally exciting and terrifying, but given humans&#8217; track record of driving promising technologies off the rails, I&#8217;m erring on the side of terrified until (hopefully) proven wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting aside a lot of the ethical issues and broader societal impacts, I&#8217;d like to narrow the focus to the world of digital interface design, and even more narrowly to the wonderful world of design systems. How will AI impact the world of UI design/development? How will AI impact how design systems are created and used? There are some extremely obvious answers to these questions, and there are also millions of other questions that haven&#8217;t been asked yet. These are uncharted waters we&#8217;re navigating here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design systems are about efficiency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why should you invest in a design system?&#8221; The answer in a bajillion posts, videos, PowerPoint decks, and conference-room conversations will all include something along the lines of: &#8220;design systems create a single source of truth for common interface solutions to promote consistency and increase team velocity and efficiency.&#8221; Something something something we&#8217;ll work faster and save money. Please fund this initiative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where does that efficiency and increased velocity come from? Well, in large part by freeing up human beings&#8217; brains and hands to focus on solving more interesting problems than ensuring a button is 44px tall instead of 43px tall. Or <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/things-you-could-be-doing-instead-of-designing-building-that-card-component-for-the-umpteenth-time/\">rebuilding the card component for the umteenth time</a>. My partner Josh Clark said it best: <a href=\"https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html\">the most exciting design systems are boring</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>When the design system is boring, it frees designers and developers to do the new stuff, to solve new problems.&nbsp;<strong>The design system carries the burden of the boring, so that designers and developers don’t have to.</strong></p>\n<cite>Josh Clark, <a href=\"https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html\">The Most Exciting Design Systems Are Boring</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s kinda the whole point of design systems. Let&#8217;s establish a toolkit of common UI solutions that other teams wield to build specific products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AI is a natural design system consumer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So how does AI slot into all of this? Perhaps the most obvious place to start is AI as a conversational interface to build product experiences. It would go something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>step 1: train the AI to understand your design system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know the technical details of achieving this, but my guess is that it certainly isn&#8217;t impossible. Hell, Airbnb <a href=\"https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/\">did it years ago</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We developed a working theory that if machine learning algorithms can classify a complex set of thousands of handwritten symbols — such as handwritten Chinese characters — with a high degree of accuracy, then we should be able to classify the 150 components within our system and teach a machine to recognize them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hey AI, here&#8217;s our design system&#8217;s component library. It&#8217;s got a few dozen components that each have these properties attached to them. They&#8217;re all TypeScripted up and the available props and values are well defined.

Especially in these early days, it&#8217;s probably necessary to have human hands and eyes massage things into place in order to take things over the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now these AI prompts are pretty amazing at iterating over things, so it&#8217;s totally possible to smooth out wrinkles using the AI tool itself (&#8220;Alright, update the &#8220;Kids&#8221; title to &#8220;Kids 5-10&#8243; and update to a different product image&#8221;). But it&#8217;s also totally possible to get it into a workable, good-enough state and then bring things over the finish line using human labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the longest time, I&#8217;ve been extolling the virtues of how a ready-to-use design system can help teams go from whiteboard sketch to working prototype in a matter of minutes. These AI tools can take that process down to seconds. Moreover, it lowers the barriers to entry so product managers, marketers, and the CEO can quickly generate new product screens without having to know how to sling Figma or code. (Designers, I can feel you squirming in your seats right now.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AI as design system creator</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Make a new component called badge that has 4 <code>variant</code>s: success, error, warning, and info. It has a <code>text</code> string prop, and a <code>size</code> prop that has <code>sm</code> and <code>lg</code> as available options. The background colors for the 4 variants should use the success, error, warning, and info background color design token variants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Splat goes the AI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact of the matter is that a lot of design system component work really is mechanical and predictable. We already use tools like <a href=\"https://plopjs.com/\">PlopJS</a> to splat out a component boilerplate that matches the shape of the rest of the library. I&#8217;d welcome AI&#8217;s assistance in generating a lot of common fare boilerplate things for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still a ton of nuance involved in creating effective (how rigid or composable should this component be? What layer of the design system should this exist? Is this a true DS component or a <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-system-components-recipes-and-snowflakes/\">recipe</a>?) that still necessitates human involvement. But it&#8217;s hard to not see the potential for AI to take away a lot of the mechanical burden involved in creating components. Testing in particular feels like a super fertile area, and our initial explorations yielded some pretty good initial results! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>They took our jobs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice it. Notice the thread. Notice the unease around the fact that the machines are coming to take your job. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When my wife began her career trajectory as a visual designer, she worked as a production designer. That entailed making different crops of banner ads, touching up photography, generating email templates, and doing other rote tasks. She got extremely skilled and efficient at removing backgrounds from images, blasting through complex paths using Photoshop&#8217;s pen tool.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, tools like <a href=\"https://removal.ai/\">removal.ai</a> automate that background-removal process, and do a pretty damn good job at it. AI cropping out backgrounds is undeniably more efficient than Photoshop&#8217;s pen tool, even if you do get damn good at wielding it. What does this mean for 20 somethings fresh out of school looking to get a foot in the door in the field of design? Does this mean fewer opportunities for fewer people? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain aspects of our jobs are absolutely at risk of being automated, especially now that technology has reached beyond the world of toll booth workers and grocery store clerks into the worlds of translators, journalists, and other knowledge workers (cringe). What do we do with that? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our design system client work, we&#8217;ve already encountered scores of designers and developers who are absolutely terrified of expanding their role beyond &#8220;rectangle creator.&#8221; Designers and developers who  think of their jobs as rectangle creators have a lot to be worried about. But in my view, designers and developers who think of their jobs as solving problems — and incidentally have to create/wield some rectangles in order to solve those problems — have less to fear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We still need critical thinking. Ethical thinking. Systematic thinking. We still need to foster relationships. To build bridges. To coordinate. To orchestrate. These are human things. These are the skills that designers and developers need to cultivate and grow in order to continue to be viable in our AI age.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Brave new world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So AI is a shoo-in to help wield a design system, and to participate in the creation of a design system&#8217;s assets. But there are many many many rocks that haven&#8217;t been turned over yet. More generative UI design (such as <a href=\"https://www.usegalileo.ai/\">Galileo AI</a>) is inevitable. If AI tools can conjure up photorealistic human portraits and build fantastical worlds, it sure as shit can splat out some Bootstrappy UI without lifting its finger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here we are at the frontier, friends. As I see it, AI makes it crystal-clear we need to be focusing on <em>why</em> we create things vs <em>what/how</em> we create. Let&#8217;s move forward with humanity, purpose, and intention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "value": "\n<p>Late last year, our friends at An Event Apart brought down the curtain of running conferences after an impressive 17-year run. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to articulate exactly how An Event Apart changed the trajectory of my life, but it did in big and meaningful ways. I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today if it weren&#8217;t for this conference and the people who ran it. I&#8217;ll forever be grateful to <a href=\"https://www.zeldman.com/\">Jeffrey</a>, Eric, Toby, and Marci for the opportunities they gave me, and for our continued friendship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeffrey reached out to me in the summer of 2012 to see if I&#8217;d be willing to fill in for another speaker at <a href=\"https://archive.aneventapart.com/2012/dc/?/2012/dc/\">An Event Apart Washington DC</a>. As it happened, the event took place right after our annual family vacation to North Carolina, so we were in the area already. And as it happened, we picked up our new bulldog puppy named Ziggy in Virginia on the way back from our vacation. So my wife and new pup dropped me off in DC for the conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"989\" height=\"989\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-17-at-12.12.25-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16434\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-17-at-12.12.25-PM.png 989w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-17-at-12.12.25-PM-700x700.png 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-17-at-12.12.25-PM-768x768.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Our new puppy Ziggy the bulldog dropping me off at An Event Apart, Washington D.C. in 2012.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, I&#8217;d only been <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/speaking/\">speaking</a> for about a year, and I was neck deep in the emerging world of responsive web design. I wrote posts like &#8220;<a href=\"http://English\">Mobile First Responsive Web Design</a>&#8220;, which I was planning on speaking about at the conference. As it happened, my slot was sandwiched right in between Luke Wroblewski (Mr. Mobile First) and Ethan Marcotte (Mr. Responsive Web Design). To say I was terrified to be wedged in between such important, articulate speakers is an extreme understatement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember too much about delivering my talk (&#8220;<a href=\"https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/2522ded3-fa7d-4415-a88c-51b92bae8736\">What happened, I blacked out</a>&#8220;), but I remember a sinking feeling in my stomach that it hadn&#8217;t gone well. I also remember both Jeffrey and Eric reassuring me that the talk went well, and me thinking they were just being polite so as not to hurt my feelings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the talk must have gone well because An Event Apart continued to invite me back over the next 8 years. Thanks to those opportunities, I was able to share my thoughts about responsive design, introduce <a href=\"https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\">atomic design</a>, share design system best practices, and talk about how designers and developers can work better together.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brad-event-apart-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Frost speaking at An Event Apart\" class=\"wp-image-16435\" srcset=\"https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brad-event-apart-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brad-event-apart-700x525.jpg 700w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brad-event-apart-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brad-event-apart-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brad-event-apart.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the conference, my credibility and reputation grew, which led to business opportunities and opened many other new doors. Many of other speakers became my close friends. I had countless insightful conversations with the conference attendees, and many of them became good friends too. Tobi and Marci, key organizers of the conference, are two of the coolest people I&#8217;ve ever met, and we&#8217;ve shared many deep conversations and laughs together over the years. And Jeffrey and Eric, personal heroes of mine who authored some of the first books I ever read about web design, became friends and mentors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously sad there will be no more An Event Apart conferences, but I&#8217;m comforted by the fact that the innumerable friendships I&#8217;ve made because of the conference will endure. Thanks for changing my life, An Event Apart. </p>\n",

This means that when <em>they</em> say something like “Best practices don’t actually work”—what they mean is “Best practices don’t actually work for a small subset of less than 5 percent of the web”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Setting aside the specific barbs levied against React and its advocates, this post&#8217;s message is important. Only a small subset of the web industry is out there on Twitter, blogging, making courses, speaking at conferences, hosting YouTube shows, etc. The web is a lot bigger than those voices, and it&#8217;s important to keep that in mind when <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/choosing-tools/\">choosing tools, </a>taking advice, and figuring out how to go about making something.</p>\n<p>This holds true for other aspects of life. We&#8217;re all influenced by cable news shows, political parties, loud podcasts, and publications, et al, but society is so much more than those channels. Reminding myself of this fact helps keep me out of a despair spiral whenever those particularly loud voices steal my attention.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s incredibly important for people that have large audiences to consider the impact of their words. I think it&#8217;s important to preserve and promote nuance when communicating. I think hot takes, combative tone, and black-and-white thinking can often be harmful and counterproductive. I think it&#8217;s important to recognize that any person&#8217;s perspective — including your own — doesn&#8217;t represent the whole picture. I think the larger a person&#8217;s reach is, the more responsibility they have to follow this advice.</p>\n",

      "value": "<p>I love web components. Being able to just plop a custom element onto a page with all the functionality baked in without needing a framework or bundling to make it work is just liberating. I know there's a lot of overhead that comes with it that libraries and frameworks aim to abstract but I just enjoy having the low-level ability to do whatever you want.</p>\n<p>The trickiest part of web components for me has been how to identify when a web components, which is written as HTML, needs to be defined through JavaScript. From a performance point-of-view, we don't want to send JavaScript to the page for components that aren't there. On the flip side, we don't want to miss components that apppear later in the lifecycle of the page.</p>\n<p>The technique I'm about to explain is something I was working on at <a href=\"https://compass.com/\">Compass</a> but was never completed. Since then I've also enhanced the approach to be a bit easier to setup.</p>\n<h2>Registrar</h2>\n<p>The core of the approach uses an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) which does a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listens for new custom elements appearing on the page.</li>\n<li>Fetches definitions for elements that are not defined.</li>\n<li>Listens within new shadow roots for additional elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's describe how it does each of these.</p>\n<h3>Listening for new custom elements</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion\">technique for detecting when an element appears in the DOM</a> is not new. It was first discovered by <a href=\"http://www.backalleycoder.com/\">Daniel Buchner</a> as early as 2012. This was the basis behind identifying when a custom element appears on the page with a few changes.</p>\n<p>First, I use <code>visibility</code> as the trigger for the animation. The reason for this is because it is not commonly used for animations like <code>opacity</code> would be. This avoids possible conflicts where these elements would be animated more traditionally. So the declaration block that triggers the animation would begin to look like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">...</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">animation</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> undefined-detection .1ms<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@keyframes</span> undefined-detection</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token selector\">to</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">visibility</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> visible<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>The missing piece is the selector to target these custom elements. In my original implementation, I would generate the list of elements to find here however, there is a better way. Because what we are looking for is custom elements that are undefined, there's a CSS selector that can target all of these.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">:not(:defined)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">animation</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> undefined-detection .1ms<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@keyframes</span> undefined-detection</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token selector\">to</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token property\">visibility</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> visible<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Yep, that's it. Now the <code>undefined-detection</code> animation will trigger for all custom elements that are not yet defined.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Greedy registration</h3>\n<p>I've noticed that custom elements that are on the page from extensions or other libraries will also attempt to be requested and ultimately fail since they aren't part of the library. This would be a benefit for having an explicit list of elements to listen for but the failures can be caught and ignored in this implementation or you could filter by prefix (i.e.; <code>ds-button</code> but not <code>random-button</code>).</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>So we will write this CSS to the <code>&lt;head/&gt;</code> of the page within the registrar and begin listening for the animation.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">ANIMATION_NAME</span> <span

words, if <code>&lt;my-element&gt;</code> appears on the page, we define it and immediately add the listener to <em>only</em> that shadow root. While it does determine if any custom elements within its lifecycle need definitions, later <code>&lt;my-element&gt;</code> components added to the page will already be defined and therefore not trigger dynamically added custom elements within those later components (because the triggering resources aren't added to subsquent shadow roots).</p>\n<p>To have true coverage, the triggering resources would need to be added to <em>all</em> shadow roots. Luckily, this could be solved by importing the node detection CSS separately within each component which will trigger the registrar to fetch the definition; something that could be part of the library building script.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token constant\">CSS</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'../registrar.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">MyElement</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>HTMLElement</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">attachShadow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">mode</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'open'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>innerHTML <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">&lt;style type=\"text/css\"></span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span><span class=\"token constant\">CSS</span><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\">&lt;/style></span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br />window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>customElements<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">define</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'my-element'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> MyElement<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Listening for defined</h3>\n<p>You may have considered another approach to use node detection to just look for defined elements.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">:defined</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">animation</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> defined-detection .1ms<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>From there we could just add the target resources to each element;

      "value": "<p>Design tokens for color and typography are fairly common for design systems. In particular, color token naming has finally gotten some traction by thinking semantically. In other words, not naming the color based on the value but the intent to use. Typography is getting some traction here as well; where naming is done by use. This tends to be easier to understand since a type style is composed of many different properties.</p>\n<p>Spacing, on the other hand, has been locked into the original token naming scheme where the name of the token relates to the value of space; not the use. Tokens are either named using T-shirt sizing or numbers with a scale of several to use.</p>\n<p>The importance of using semantic tokens is to limit the decision making for the designer. The designer should focus on crafting the experience in a wireframe-like mindset. Color, typography, and other styles are noise that distracts from solving user problems. The design system should have the guidance to make clear decisions and reduce the noise.</p>\n<p>So the question is, how do we give meaning to spacing tokens?</p>\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/gestalt-proximity/\">Gestalt principle of proximity</a> describes that elements that are close to each other are meant to be considered more related to each other than elements more far away. This is the principle we as designers are implementing when we decide the amount space used between elements.</p>\n<p>But how do we choose exactly how much space? Often times it's looking at the whole page and picking what <em>feels right</em> with a few constraints (like using multiples of 8 for the values). However, the system cannot give guidance about <em>feelings</em>, it should have clear reasons as to why to choose an amount of space.</p>\n<p>The way I've identified an amount of space is by social relationships. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation\">Degrees of separation</a> describes the way that entities are social connected to each other. We can think of parent-children or siblings that live in the same house to be 1 degree of separation from each other, while next door neighbors might be 2 degrees.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>I've explored the idea of describing space as degrees briefly and it doesn't fit well. While there's enough friction with the naming scheme to have users pause and read the guidance, it's still using a scale to determine the space.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Now, if we consider these entities as elements of an interface, the parent-child and sibling relationships translate. The parent <code>&lt;ul/&gt;</code> element and its children <code>&lt;li/&gt;</code> elements can have 1 degree of separation; meaning they are very closely related. While the <code>&lt;ul/&gt;</code> element and its <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> ancestor element may not be as close.</p>\n<p>Keep this in mind as we review the next topic; density contexts.</p>\n<h2>Density contexts</h2>\n<p>I spent a great deal of time gazing at the first image in <a href=\"https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/space-in-design-systems-188bcbae0d62\">Nathan Curtis's post about Spacing in Design Systems</a>. Here's the image from the post:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/nathan-curtis-space.png\" alt=\"Example cards\" /></p>\n<p>If we were to use the mental model we've come up with above, the tags within each card are 1 degree of separation apart from each other; in this comp a value of 8. The paragraph above is different from the tags, or in the next house. That can be described as 2 degrees of separation between the paragraph and tags.</p>\n<p>All of this works fairly well within the card, describing all the relationships of detail and space within. Where this is fuzzy is the cards themselves; each card is clearly an indentical sibling of the next and by our rules should have 1 degree of separation between. That was previously shown inside the card as 8, but here it is 32 and this <em>feels</em> correct, but how do we describe this?</p>\n<p>The answer is density contexts.</p>\n<p><strong>Every time we dive deeper into the content of the page, it is an opportunity to reduce the density of the area</strong>. This would reduce the amount of space around and between elements but maintain the relationships we aim to describe.</p>\n<p>Let's say, we start at the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code>. Lots of space between sections of the page because they are very unrelated. Maybe one section includes a card layout like the one above. We then shift the density down one notch and tighten the space between the children in this area. Going down into a card, we shift another notch down and tighten further showing that this content is most closely related.</p>\n<p>So each new density context defines the way space is used within that context. If you want less space between items because you want to show a close relation; add a new density shift and all the space within will reduce. This allows for the space between each card and the space between each tag to both be 1 degree of separation but the resolved value to be different because we are in a new density context.</p>\n<p>Now the designer chooses the density context for this particular experience but what about the actual token names? How do we give meaning to the locations where the values should be expressed?</p>\n<h2>Padding and gap</h2>\n<p>We can think of padding as the <strong>space around</strong> an element and the gap as <strong>space between</strong> elements. In the cards referenced within the image above, we can use these definitions to describe the spacing used in most of the elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spacing between the tags is a gap.</li>\n<li>Spacing between the headings (video and supernova) is a gap.</li>\n<li>Spacing between the headings, paragraph, tags, and the button is a gap.</li>\n<li>Spacing between each card is a gap.</li>\n<li>All other spacing is padding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each time the value of the gap changes signifies a density shift downward. First we start at a density where the gap equals 32, then we shift down (within the card) to a gap that equals 16, and finally we shift once more (inside each part of the card) where the gap equals 8.</p>\n<p>So do we just use token names that describe padding and gap? Almost.</p>\n<h2>Tying it together</h2>\n<p>Going back to degrees of separation, I realized that trying to define larger degrees of separation would be difficult, especially when naming them with meaning. However, after compleing the exploration and identifying that there are really only two places where we need to apply space (around and between), that means I could reduce the number of spacing tokens down to 2 for most usage. That resulted in the following two names.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--spacing--near</code>: often used to describe the spacing between elements showing close relation.</li>\n<li><code>--spacing--away</code>: often used to describe the spacing around elements showing less relation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I use near and away because there are areas where we want to use these values that aren't confined to the guidance above. Buttons are the best example, where we want the space on the horizontal axis to be greater than the vertical. Setting <code>button { padding: var(--spacing--near) var(--spacing--away) }</code> doesn't break the mental model as much as if we used the word &quot;gap&quot; within the padding values for the button.</p>\n<p>And that's it, you can create an interface in terms of relationships and density systematically with a very small number of design decisions with clear guidance. Below is a Codepen where I've recreated the card using this approach:</p>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Spacing context\"

sequence</a> for the steps since designers love that <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/golden-ratio-ui-design/\">golden ratio in layout</a>.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<h2>+ Typography</h2>\n<p>You can take this one step further by including typography. If you consider that each use of typography is included into a category, the type scale could ramp based on the density instead of in isolation. This allows for a clearer relationship between typography and space as many designers strive for through vertical rhythm and a grid system.</p>\n<p>If you identify categories of typography with proper guidance for each you can connect the density to the category. Body text becomes larger in hero images and smaller in general areas. Perhaps even smaller for data-dense interfaces like tables. Each area uses the same type style but the density changes the size.</p>\n<h2>Real world examples</h2>\n<p>If you're interested in how this all works in a real site or system, <strong>the <a href=\"https://damato.design/\">damato.design</a> family of sites all use the above approach to determine spacing + typography</strong>, including this site. I will admit determining where to add the density shift is the bigger challenge but what helps is to identify where the <code>--spacing--near</code> and <code>--spacing--away</code> values should go first, then determine if the density should shift as the second step.</p>\n<p>One more note, in the <a href=\"https://system.damato.design/\">DAMATO Design System</a>, we do not have many typography categories; only display, heading, standard, and detail. This restricts the number of heading levels to only display and heading which loses content hierarchy unless shifting density. We could include more typography categories to describe a few additional levels (title, subtitle, etc) but opted to exclude for simplicity.</p>",

      "value": "<p>There are tons of definitions of design tokens on the web. Enough that I won't link to them here and you can find your favorite one with a web search. Many of the examples of design tokens show a relationship that looks something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>color-blue-500</code> ⬅ <code>#0000ff</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here, there's a name that represents the value. The naming in this example indicates a few things like the category (color) then a family within the category (blue) and finally a way of showing a relation between similar tokens of the same depth (500). This was well advertised through the <a href=\"https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html\">material design color palettes</a>.</p>\n<h2>The immediate problem</h2>\n<p>Now let's say we design a button, and we want to give it an accent color from our palette. Maybe this is also our brand color and used for a few other marketing items as well.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.btn</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-blue-500<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-white<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Seems harmless. That is until you get a message from marketing and the brand colors are changing. What do you do? You might think a quick fix would be to do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>color-blue-500</code> ⬅ <code>orange</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because <code>color-blue-500</code> is the brand color, it'll update in all of the spots. Clearly this isn't a good approach because the name no longer matches the value.</p>\n<p>Instead you'd have to update all of the places where the brand color was used.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.btn</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-orange-500<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-white<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Oh wait, is that white accessible on the orange? That might need to be updated too!</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.btn</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-orange-500<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-black<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, you'd be combing through existing assets; looking for areas that need to be updated and never being sure you've gotten everything. We need a better system and you can probably give a recommendation already. Let's change the mapping to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>color-primary</code> ⬅ <code>orange</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, I can use that name without worrying about the value.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.btn</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--color-primary<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>It doesn't yet solve the relational colors (ie., the text color) but we'll get there.</p>\n<h2>Provide intention</h2>\n<p>The concept that I'm describing is not new. It is a token naming approach that attempts to loosen the description of the value by providing more meaning. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis\">Nathan Curtis</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/naming-tokens-in-design-systems-9e86c7444676\">lands on this idea</a> through an exploration of other systems' naming conventions without explicitly calling them more than design tokens.</p>\n<p>What Nathan calls <em>concepts</em> in his post is the basis behind the naming convention that I've been calling <em>intents</em> since 2017 which is a term coined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephschmitt\">Joe Schmitt</a>. The idea is that <strong>the token name should describe an intention, not the value</strong>.</p>\n<p>As a designer, I want to place a button inside of a card. What kind of button should go into that card? I don't mean what color or font size, I mean <em>what kind of button</em>. When we design an interface we are making decisions about the kind of thing to use that is expected to help the user move forward. We decide to use a primary button because we want to draw the user's attention here first before any other action. The kind of button is primary due to its priority and the decision I'm making is an <strong>intent</strong>. We can separate the intent from the styles we associate with that intent.</p>\n<p>Another example would be an alert banner. Which banner should I use to show your credit card is about to expire? I'm not looking for the orange banner, I'm looking for the warning banner. I intend to describe to the user that this message is a warning. If you think in this way, the style of the warning is not important. It's the decision about how we expect to convey this message that is important.</p>\n<p>If you fully adopt this approach, this helps by teaching the user similarly styled things have the same behavior. It'll be easy for a user to identify all primary actions or warning statuses because they have the same treatment (or have the same intent) across uses.</p>\n<p>To be clear <strong>intents are tokens</strong>. They just have a special purpose in the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>A new system of naming</h2>\n<p>If we use the intent based naming system, the mapping might have an assignment like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>feedback-warning-surface-color</code> ⬅ <code>color-orange-500</code></li>\n<li><code>feedback-warning-onsurface-color</code> ⬅ <code>#fff</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice that the right-hand side can be a raw value or some other variable. It might help for these to be reusable variables like <code>color-orange-500</code> because you might reuse this value is other places. What matters is that the intent name (the left-hand side) does not change.</p>\n<p>Those intent names are describing parts of the experience where we intend to show a warning by using a background color and a foreground color. When you set an intent as a component property value, this is effectively a marriage. It should never change.</p>\n<p>Now we can use the <code>feedback-warning-surface-color</code> in places of the experience where we intend to show a warning. These areas will not change their intent! We will always show a warning here, even if we style it differently later.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.alert-warning</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--feedback-warning-surface-color<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--feedback-warning-onsurface-color<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>With this system, you are able to support any variation of theming; light &amp; dark mode, brand changes, private labeling, etc.. All you need to do is store different mappings of values to intents (aka. <em>theme</em>). Maybe in one theme, warnings need to be shown in red. In that theme change the mapping for warning backgrounds to red.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>feedback-warning-surface-color</code> ⬅ <code>color-red-300</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You'll never need to go into the components to make a change as long as we use intents to describe the styles. Just make a new theme and give the experience a new look.</p>\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<p>I've have a few years of experience with this approach and want to document some of the pitfalls to avoid when implementing.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid the words light and dark</strong>. You might consider trying this for buttons that appear on inverted backgrounds. Instead, I recommend setting an inverted theme within that container so it can cover all of the possible treatments within. Remember, it's probably not just the button that needs to be inverted, there's probably text or input fields that might need coverage too. If you really need to show a relationship use the word &quot;contrast&quot; instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Make naming relative to the page styles</strong>. I recommend a very generic category called &quot;box&quot; which in its simplest form describes the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> styles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>box-background-color</code>: The <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> background color.</li>\n<li><code>box-foreground-color</code>: The <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> text / icon color related to the background.</li>\n<li><code>box-border-color</code>: The most common border color for boxes which will share the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> background color.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my experience there might be another kind of container that is meant to show a visual difference from the body background. I tend to name this <code>boxLowContrast</code> because it is still relational to the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code>. If you have more variations that this, you'll have to get creative with your naming here. Remember, this is for generic non-interactive containers. You can have additional categories for more meaningful containers.</p>\n<p>Doing this allows you to keep in the mindset of a theme when completing the mapping.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token comment\">// \"light theme\"</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"box-background-color\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#fff\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// white</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"box-foreground-color\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#000\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// black</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token comment\">// \"dark theme\"</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"box-background-color\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#000\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// black</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"box-foreground-color\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#fff\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// white</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p><strong>Start with generic categories</strong>. A component is not necessarily an intent. You can consider a tab to be a part of an actionable category. Perhaps dive a step deeper into a navigational category. However, I would not recommend making a &quot;tab&quot; category.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>action-background-color</code>: Generic, describes all interactive element backgrounds.</li>\n<li><code>navigation-background-color</code>: More specific, describes all interactive element backgrounds which are meant for navigation.</li>\n<li><code>tab-background-color</code>: Very specific, only describes the tab background color.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some categories that have worked well in the past:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>box</strong>: Describes generic non-interactive containers, eg. <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>action</strong>: Describes interactive containers, eg. <code>&lt;button/&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>navigation</strong>: Describes interactive containers for the purpose of navigation, eg. <code>&lt;a/&gt;</code> (link).</li>\n<li><strong>control</strong>: Describes interactive containers for the purpose of inputting information, eg. <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>feedback</strong>: Describes non-interactive containers for the purpose of indicating a system state to the user, eg. banners, badges, notifications.</li>\n<li><strong>figure</strong>: Describes the use of color meant to segregate entities, eg. data-visualizations, illustrations, default avatar colors.</li>\n<li><strong>text</strong>: Describes all use of typography, more on this later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The feedback and figure colors are unlike the others. For the feedback category I recommend the following set of properties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>feedback-[type]-surface-color</code>: Describes when the background is used to indicate the status through color. This is meant for banners that use the background as the color accent.</li>\n<li><code>feedback-[type]-onsurface-color</code>: Describes the color to use for elements that appear on the <code>feedback-[type]-surface-color</code> such as text and icons.</li>\n<li><code>feedback-[type]-foreground-color</code>: Describes when the text is used to indicate the status through color. An example of this might be error text underneath an input field. This color is related to the <code>box-background-color</code> in terms of contrast and application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A caveat here is that if you attempt to put more complicated experiences within a container which has <code>feedback-[type]-surface-color</code>, the related <code>feedback-[type]-onsurface-color</code> will have difficulty applying coverage to the elements within. The recommendation here is to keep the feedback to text and icons only.</p>\n<p>The figure category is the least well understood. The best way to curate this is to order the colors by expected popularity within coloring illustrations. This is also a good area to consider having more specific categories if necessary. For example, if the colors used for illustrations are different from those being used within data-visualizations. Otherwise I just number these to indicate popularity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>figure-color-1</code>: The most used color within illustrations (other than box colors).</li>\n<li><code>figure-color-2</code>: The next most used color within illustrations.</li>\n<li><code>figure-color-3</code>: ...and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've avoided trying to describe intents for the purposes of marketing because decisions of color there are often based on associated with given photography. In these areas you might opt to actual hard code the color because of the close association with the surrounding material and not necessarily with the overall page. Another recommendation might be to just have the following intents to only be used in places where the brand should be highlighted and not for areas with better intents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>feedback-brand-surface-color</code></li>\n<li><code>feedback-brand-onsurface-color</code></li>\n<li><code>feedback-brand-foreground-color</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Create additional variations to each category</strong> as necessary or potentially extend variations to others. For example we can imagine that all interactive categories will require a &quot;hover&quot; variation. Which would mean the following intents may exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>actionHovered-foreground-color</code></li>\n<li><code>navigationHovered-foreground-color</code></li>\n<li><code>controlHovered-foreground-color</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember to cover all of the possible states that your interaction might have.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>I've chosen to use the past tense to describe these states to indicate what has happened. You can think about this with the word &quot;selected&quot; where we wouldn't use the word &quot;select&quot; to describe the state. You can also think of the word you might use if combined with &quot;is&quot; (ie., is hovered, is focused).</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>One more note, if you are using focus rings, I recommend associating the ring with the <em>box</em> category because the ring visually appears on the box, not on the interactive element. As you might expect, having the same focus treatment across all interactive elements will be best and having it associated with the box category makes this easy to maintain. This would also go for shadows, although shadows have much more to do with light cast rather than a theme and could be avoided altogether.</p>\n<h2>Typography</h2>\n<p>I've mentioned in the recommendation that there should be an entire intent category dedicated to text. This is meant to have the same approach where each kind of text is identified based on purpose. Here are the variations that seem to work best.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heading</strong>: Meant for large titles.</li>\n<li><strong>Title</strong>: Meant for small titles.</li>\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: Meant for text within interactive elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Input</strong>: Meant for text within text fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Caption</strong>: Meant for text providing additional detail, like help &amp; error messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn't including the default category. So you'd see the following in a theme:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token comment\">// default theme</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"text-font-weight\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">400</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// body font weight</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"textHeading-font-weight\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">700</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">\"textTitle-font-weight\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">600</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  ...<br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Clearly, this method doesn't support different levels of content hierarchy with just this collection of tokens alone. To do that you could either base the type scale on density (as is done here in the <a href=\"https://damato.design/\">damato.design</a> family of sites.) or use the given font size as a base to compute additional font sizes using a set scale. That's an explanation for another post.</p>\n<h2>And beyond</h2>\n<p>From here you can include additional properties to each category or even add categories as your organization needs. Here within the <a href=\"https://system.damato.design/\">damato.design system</a> we have identified <code>border-size</code>, <code>border-curve</code>, and <code>density-size</code> as additions to the box category to describe those features.</p>",

      "value": "<p>Atomic design as an idea I agree with; parts of your system are built from smaller parts. What I don't agree with is the image that has been floating around the internet which introduces people to the concept:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/brad-frost-atomic.png\" alt=\"Atomic design guide showing small parts becoming larger\" /></p>\n<p>If you think about this, how could an organism (a living thing) become a template (a non-living thing)? If you think I'm taking the image too literally; that's the point. People around the design community have taken the naming convention provided by design as the standard and using it to communicate where something lives within the system.</p>\n<p>So here's a simple question, where would I find the dropdown component in this system? If you know about atomic design this is probably a molecule. If you <em>don't know</em> about atomic design (perhaps like many engineers looking for a component), then it could be a molecule or an organism by process of elimination.</p>\n<p>However, even if you know about atomic design the examples can also conflict. The canonical example of an organism in <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\">the original post</a> is a masthead. However, the masthead could be a reusable template because the megamenu within the masthead could be a organism. The lines become blurry about what exists at each level even for folks who follow atomic design. There's a lots of room for debate about what a particular part of the interface should be categorized as. That debate will only cause confusion and distract from the purpose of the idea.</p>\n<p>So here's the easy fix:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/revised-atomic.png\" alt=\"Atomic design guide showing small parts becoming larger\" /></p>\n<p><strong>#naming-is-hard</strong>. The naming is what hurts the approach.</p>\n<h2>Definitions</h2>\n<p>I'm going to also include some definitions that I've developed while working with design system people and resources that might help bridge communications across disciplines.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product teams</strong>: The group of individual contributors who are responsible for bringing product concepts to life; commonly comprised of designers and developers.</li>\n<li><strong>Patterns</strong>: Recommended, content-agnostic compositions that have not yet been formally named or packaged which are meant to host content, interactivity or feedback for product team use.</li>\n<li><strong>Components</strong>: Patterns that have been promoted to reusable packaged resources which simplify the options that the original pattern suggested using internal logic.</li>\n<li><strong>Fragments</strong>: Components only meant to be used to compose more complex components. These are not commonly used by members outside of the team responsible for them. An example might be a modal backdrop.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Components</strong>: Components meant to support a specific product or feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Universal Components</strong>: Components meant to support all products and features.</li>\n<li><strong>Layouts</strong>: Reusable compositions for visual arrangement; analogous to the use within artboards.</li>\n<li><strong>Templates</strong>: Reusable compositions for data arrangement; analogous to the use within database schemas.</li>\n<li><strong>Modules</strong>: Components populated and configured by people outside of product teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason we give names to anything is to share ideas. If the name doesn't properly identify the idea in a repeatable way; it's a signal that the name doesn't support the idea well. My recommendation is to not take the atomic design system naming convention literally but instead to execute on the concept that an interface is a collection of increasing complex compositions. The naming used within the system should be developed so that it meets expectations for most introduced to the system and limits ambiguity.</p>",

      "value": "<p>Have you ever landed on a web page and have it immediately ask you for a location? How about while you are reading an article and, after you scroll down to read more, you get an advertisement covering your next paragraph? These are super annoying patterns but why are they annoying?</p>\n<h2>Surprising popups</h2>\n<p>When a user has a specific goal in mind and an interruption occurs, the user will find it annoying if that interruption does not relate to their current workflow. This can be expanded to any generic UX pattern; where expectations aren't met and frustration increases. However, there is a special place for popups because they <em>interrupt</em>.</p>\n<p>There is a fine line between the popup and the modal. <strong>The modal <em>must be related</em> to the user's current workflow</strong>. This means that the user triggered this popup and it meets the user's expectations.</p>\n<h2>Reasons to use a modal</h2>\n<p>The designer could choose a modal to interrupt the user (as all popups do) and cause the user to slow down for some important information in order to proceed. A good example is the destructive confirmation modal which helps ensure that the delete button press was intended. The user is expected to do a bit more work here so important data isn't erased. So, the designer requires one more hit target to be pressed before continuing. The modal here also shows that the user can return to the original state just behind the message and that nothing has changed yet.</p>\n<p>Along with this previous idea, another valid reason to provide a modal is to show the user that they are still within the current context. A good example here is adding an image to a blog post. It would be more helpful to show that the user's content remains while completing a new task of selecting an asset from the gallery. If we were to provide a new page for this experience, the user would not be confident that their content was saved. Showing that their content is persistent behind the modal establishes trust that the user will return as they once left.</p>\n<p>So to recap, you may consider using a modal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you believe the user must slow down before continuing the current task.</li>\n<li>if you believe the user does not trust that current changes will persist while they need to complete a different but related task.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Questionable practices</h2>\n<p>I've seen dozens of workflows using a modal which could have been another pattern entirely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the user could return to the experience using a url; the experience should probably be a new page.</li>\n<li>If the user needs to create or edit an entity with many fields (eg.: a profile, a product); the experience should probably be a new page or incorporated into the current experience.</li>\n<li>If the user needs to edit a value; the experience should probably be incorporated into the current experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example that I've seen recently is a profile review experience. Once clicking your avatar in the application a <em>modal</em> appears above your current workflow. From here you can edit fields and save to return. However, you may also change your avatar photo. After selecting a photo, you are presented <em>another modal</em> allowing the user to resize the photo and save the changes, returning you to the previous modal. So how could this experience be redesigned?</p>\n<p>First, clicking on your profile should navigate the user to their profile. We expect this to be a url and therefore a new page. From here, the user is given several fields of values they can edit directly. Let's continue with this pattern by allowing the user to edit their avatar here as well. Use a slider to resize and drag-and-drop to reposition the photo in the thumbnail. The profile would hold the original image and on save, it would provide an avatar sized adjustment of that original for use across the site. We've taken a multi-modal experience to a zero-modal one.</p>\n<p>Let's be clear here, I'm not recommending to remove <em>all</em> modals from experiences. As mentioned above, if the user was able to delete their profile, a modal confirming the action would be helpful for the reasons stated above. Although even this could be avoided by requiring the user type a word or phrase into a field before executing the destructive action. It shows deliberate intent over accidental button clicks.</p>\n<p>It's common to find modals used to login or signup. Consider using a separate page unless you allow the user to make customizations before creating an account. In this case, you'll consider using a modal to show unauthenticated progress is maintained while they complete the signup process. Make sure the signup process is reduced down to the essential fields. Allow the user to include additional information later in their profile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/\">NN/Group</a> also provides a few additional recommendations for when to use modals. One of the examples is a wizard which breaks down a complicated workflow into steps. What's important here is the second paragraph:</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog\">\n<p>However, it’s important to note that a modal with multiple steps will just prolong the amount of time spent away from the main tasks, making it more likely that users will forget what they were doing in the first place.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog\"><cite>https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>In my opinion this describes that we <em>shouldn't</em> be using a modal for wizards and instead provide a navigational pattern linking to pages sequentially; allowing the user to return to steps easily. This is also relevant to their following comment about lessening a user's effort. The point of designing an experience is to do just that. So, asking if the user is working with an agent could be a question exposed as a checkbox while filling out the form for a open house. That selection could be saved for subsequent open house requests. This simplifies the experience instead of disrupting the user with a question the system forgot to ask when it was more relevant.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the real estate industry, many web sites of this genre use a <a href=\"https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/components/lightbox/\">lightbox</a> (ie. a carousel in a modal) due to the need for viewing a set of high quality images of a property. Without diving too deeply into <a href=\"https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/\">the decision to use a carousel</a>, the decision to use a modal is debateable. Full screen images could be provided as separate urls; making the photos easily sharable to other interested parties. Closing the experience could return the user back to the listing; just like a close button would. Browser navigation could also assist in wayfinding between photos and the original listing along with common carousel-like controls.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Attempting to make a modal fully accessible is a serious challenge. For example, you'll need to indicate that a new area of the page has been created, and focus must enter this area and be trapped for the duration of the experience until the task is complete. At which point, focus must return to the initial trigger of the modal. What actually receives focus (a child of the modal or the modal itself) is actually <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/03/05/open-dialog.html\">up for debate</a>; making a recommendation for it unclear. Additionally, events should not occur behind the modal which is easier said than done. Even with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/inert\">the new <code>inert</code> attribute</a>, ensuring that other elements are still accessible could be tricky with the introduction of third-party resources that need events outside of the modal.</p>\n<p>As you might imagine, things become increasing difficult with <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/1241\">more modals</a> added to the experience. How to juggle focus? What the screen reader should announce? How to navigate between these popups?</p>\n<p>Even <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog\">the native <code>&lt;dialog/&gt;</code> element</a> <a href=\"https://a11y-dialog.netlify.app/advanced/dialog-element/\">isn't shipped fully accessible</a>. At the moment, we can't even trust the browsers to support accessibility like other elements do. There's no avoiding some amount of custom behavior which is bound to have variations of approach and unintended feature gaps.</p>\n<h2>As a design constraint</h2>\n<p>The modal should not live at the top of the designer's toolbox. Make it a design constraint instead. Explore possible workflows without the modal and see how far you can get. I have confidence that most experiences can avoid the modal pattern for something more useful.</p>\n<p>It's important to truly design with emphathy when crafting an experience. Perhaps, we should provide a double confirmation pattern before choosing some design directions? Imagine that!</p>",

      "value": "<p>When I was exploring the next version of the design system for <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\">Compass</a>, I was really interested in how I could keep designers from recreating symbols that we already have represented in code. They'd have to painstakingly make all of the possible states and interactions for every component for the design library. I knew there was a better way so I cobbled a few systems together in order to do it.</p>\n<h2>Legacy system</h2>\n<p>I was an early adopter of <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> and leveraged it to visualize the components I was building for the new design system. Writing a story was helpful to create one ideal state, or perhaps wiring it into the knobs addon allows for different configurations to happen with a few button clicks. However, what I really wanted was to generate stories based on the configuration options for each component. I was working on a very early prototype with web components so I didn't have proptypes to hook into. I opted to create an <code>component.props.js</code> file for each component to help generate configurations.</p>\n<p>From here, I used a package called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/combos\"><code>combos</code></a> to create all the possible permutations of options and then create a new Storybook file to read with those new generated components. This was also used to create the files required for <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brainly/html-sketchapp\"><code>html-sketchapp</code></a>, which could render the HTML into <a href=\"https://www.sketch.com/\">Sketch</a> symbols.</p>\n<h2>Component Story Format</h2>\n<p>Storybook is no longer focusing on their initial implementation of writing stories, <a href=\"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/lib/core/docs/storiesOf.md\">the <code>storiesOf()</code> function</a>, in favor of the <a href=\"https://github.com/ComponentDriven/csf\">Component Story Format (CSF)</a>. The CSF is described as an open standard for UI component examples based on JavaScript ES6 modules. And the way to write a story seems fairly simple:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">title</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'atoms/Button'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">text</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">Hello</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">emoji</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">😀😎👍💯</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>The default export is the metadata about your story; the title, the component, and maybe some additional configuration options. Each named export is a story. So in the above example, you'd have two stories. One named &quot;Text&quot; and one named &quot;Emoji&quot;. And coming soon, <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/blog/component-story-format-3-0/\">CSF v3</a> will introduce an even smaller amount of code to create a story:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">component</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> Button <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> text <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">args</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">children</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Hello'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> emoji <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">args</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">children</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'😀😎👍💯'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>However, if you know anything about the JavaScript module ecosystem you'll see the problem with my goal. <strong>There's no way to generate stories using CSF</strong>. In fact, Storybook doesn't even treat this file as a <em>real</em> module at first. Storybook will actually read this file, create an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">abstract syntax tree (AST)</a> and then begin parsing the file for information <a href=\"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/lib/csf-tools/src/CsfFile.ts\">[source]</a>.</p>\n<p>Let's compare this to the original <code>storiesOf()</code> method of writing stories.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token function\">storiesOf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'atoms/Button'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> module<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">add</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'text'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">Hello</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">add</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'emoji'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">😀😎👍💯</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre>\n<p>You can see that the original method of writing stories is more flexible and allows for someone to create a collection of stories and begin iterating to add to Storybook. Here's a cute one-liner to define a collection of stories.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> stories <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token function-variable function\">text</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">Hello</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  <span class=\"token function-variable function\">emoji</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token plain-text\">😀😎👍💯</span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"token class-name\">Button</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />Object<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">entries</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>stories<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">reduce</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">acc<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> fn<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> acc<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">add</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> fn<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token function\">storiesOf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'Button'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> module<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>Interestingly, it seems that <a href=\"https://medium.com/@domyen/storiesof-is-not-deprecated-598c322588c\">CSF compiled to <code>storiesOf()</code></a> for Storybook but I'm not sure if that's still the case.</p>\n<h2>If it ain't broke</h2>\n<p>While Storybook no longer recommends the <code>storiesOf()</code> approach because it <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-on-demand-architecture/\">conflicts with improvement plans</a>; we can still use it today. Here's how I'd begin to integrate with a React ecosystem; reading <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types\"><code>PropTypes</code></a> to generate stories.</p>\n<p>First, we need a way to read proptypes from a component. Luckily, there's a package for that: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-prop-types\"><code>parse-prop-types</code></a>. Here's how we might begin to use this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> parsePropTypes <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'parse-prop-types'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">component</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> proptypes <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">parsePropTypes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>component<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>If you get a collection of types that all return as <code>'custom'</code>, you'll need to include the following before defining proptypes for each component.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token string\">'parse-prop-types'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>For more information, like the return object structure, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://github.com/diegohaz/parse-prop-types/blob/master/README.md\">the project's <code>README.md</code></a>.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Next, we'll need to prepare a collection of properties and possible values. For <code>type: 'bool'</code> and <code>type: 'oneOf'</code>, the values are fairly straight forward. We'll put these in a lookup object for easy access.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">DEFAULT_TYPE_ASSIGN</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token string-property property\">'bool'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  <span class=\"token string-property property\">'oneOf'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> meta <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> meta<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>type<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>value<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>For the inputs like <code>number</code> or <code>string</code>, we'll need to allow custom fixtures to be included. We'll prepare an <code>options</code> argument for our function to supply this.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">component<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> options</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> fixtures <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> options<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> proptypes <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">parsePropTypes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>component<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>The <code>fixtures</code> option will be an object that has each prop as a key and an array of possible values. Now we can send that into our assignments; choosing the correct fixture prior to running the function. We'll see how this works later.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">DEFAULT_TYPE_ASSIGN</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token string-property property\">'bool'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  <span class=\"token string-property property\">'oneOf'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> meta <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> meta<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>type<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>value<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  <span class=\"token string-property property\">'string'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> fixture <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> fixture<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br />  <span class=\"token string-property property\">'number'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> fixture <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> fixture<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>You can continue to add more as needed. I specifically omit the <code>func</code> type since it's not a visual change but you can include it if it'll help your project.</p>\n<p>Ok, we're ready to loop through all of the proptypes.</p>\n<pre

I opted for a simple <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sindresorhus/slugify\"><code>slugify</code></a> of the <code>JSON</code> to create the identifier.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code

code to implement here, you can use your imagination.</p>\n<h2>Cool, what should we do with this?</h2>\n<p>For starters, this would a good way to begin generating assets for your component library. The <a href=\"https://story.to.design/\">story.to.design</a> tool by <a href=\"https://divriots.com/\">‹div›RIOTS</a> can transform stories into <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a> components. This'll help keep the Figma library up to date with the code because it's pulling from the code. Imagine, writing minimal code to generate all of these assets!</p>\n<p>It's also a good way to determine configurations that you may not have expected. Perhaps you notice with review of the permutations, icons in inline buttons don't work well, so you might want to set a conditional in the component to either warn or omit the icons.</p>\n<p>Speaking of checking configurations, this would be great for testing. You could ensure a check in every configuration for some baseline metrics and even assert that all configurations that use the same props will render in the same expected way. This is truly a full coverage scenario without writing much code.</p>\n<h2>Full circle</h2>\n<p>This brings me back to the introduction of the CSF format; which doesn't support this type of behavior at all. There's <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Storybook-Combos-a5abecd87e9c4e0b86277244af093aea\">a document</a> outlining the possibility of &quot;Storybook Combos&quot;, which is only a proposal with no affirmitive direction yet.</p>\n<p>I hope that whatever the future holds for Storybook that the team sees the benefits of <code>storiesOf()</code> and attempts to support the ability for dynamic stories in the future. I'm sure the design system community has more use-cases for dynamic stories that are past just the needs outlined above.</p>",

Many people across the design industry shared and discussed these ideas for the coming weeks and I really enjoyed seeing all of the positive affirmations and interest in how we might avoid grids in artboards to hand off responsive web designs.</p>\n<p>However, there were others that didn't understand the point I was trying to make. This is my opportunity to address these comments and help clarify where the mark was missed.</p>\n<h2>Reddit</h2>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/oq1ogb/comment/h690qdi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">\n<p>It reads like a long-form rant complete with broken grammar.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/oq1ogb/comment/h690qdi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\"><cite>del_rio</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>Rant is probably true. The fact that we've been attempting to design the web like a canvas instead of a document is a complaint about the norms that we've accepted.

The negative dimension that I am quoted on writing is the foundational part of the calculation that allows for a container-query-like layout conditional in that approach. The approach is very complicated looking at first glance and admittedly it isn't helpful with all the additional variables that I included in order for the <code>gap</code> property to be supported but the end result of allowing the contents to determine when they should change the layout instead of the page is clearly helpful as precedented by native container queries coming to browsers very soon.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28120029\">\n<p>Renaming the column-gap property to --gap-spacing doesn't mean you're &quot;not using a grid.&quot;</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28120029\"><cite>qkqk</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>This person might have missed the intro of gridless.design but I call out that I am not talking about <code>display: grid;</code> as an tool to avoid. You can use things that are named &quot;grid&quot; in the process but I'm specifically interested in how we can avoid including the design grid in the hand off process to engineers and even further not using it at all when designing for the web. It has very little to do with the CSS property of the same name.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28119631\">\n<p>As somebody who just began using grids in their designs, I can say that grids can have a really nice effect on a lot of layouts.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28119631\"><cite>Rd6n6</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>It's true! Grids make layouts easy and its very much the reason why they work so well for graphic design. However, the final publishing of a graphic design will always have the same layout of elements, the same copy, the same orientation, etc.. On the web, this simply is not the case. What your originally provided in your design will very often not be the same as what your end-user sees. I call out the affects of translation alone and how words will often break out of neatly designed containers. Forcing your content into pink cages will ultimately break usability in designs in the most extreme cases.</p>\n<p>I think learning about the design grid for people introduced to design is helpful as a elementary concept but for more scalable experiences, the grid will do more harm than good.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28119293\">\n<p>Visually, the &quot;no&quot; grid website just looked like a website created with CSS Grid.

Prescribing what happens at a breakpoint is a lazy solution, in my opinion. Considering how elements might shift in different viewports, orientations, translations, writing-modes, etc. is not scalable as artboards. Having conversations will make more inclusive designs.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28121827\">\n<p>I, personally, prescribe to the 1px grid system - where I write all my widths, heights and offsets in multiples of 1px.

This aesthetic-usability effect can mask UI problems and can prevent issue discovery during usability testing.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/\"><cite>Kate Moran, Nielsen Norman Group</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>The difference between the two statments is that the former suggests that its good to hide usability problems with garnish. The latter addresses that this is a problem when measuring success accurately. I believe that color is part of that avoidable garnish.</p>\n<h2>Full transparency</h2>\n<p>I'm color deficient. You might have heard of this as color-blindness however, I am not blind to color. I do not see the world in only black &amp; white. I can see colors, just not as well compared to most people. I can appreciate a good synthwave hot pink most of the time. However I also don't believe that the world should be black &amp; white. Color provides personality and identity. There's emotion behind each selection and often relates to an opinion of a piece looking attractive or replusive. It is clearly a driver of some decisions but hardly ones that direct a critical path of usability.</p>\n<h2>Art is not design</h2>\n<p>Art is a freedom of an artist's expression; an attempt to convey a feeling through their medium. It is commonly an egocentric activity to achieve a desired appearance. This is in contrast to design which is striving for altruism and inclusivity. This is supported through pattern recognition and reusing familiar experiences to achieve a goal. Design systems are the ultimate solution for achieving this cohesive experience; establishing trust between the user and the product. One deviation from past experience could be enough for the user to hesitate on the next step or stop the progress indefinitely.</p>\n<p>In design, form follows function. It means that something should be usable before it is beautiful. In order to do this, we must identify the problem we need to solve. In a qualified user experience practice, this will not begin with designing an interface but with research. Interviews, competitive analysis, user personas, and all the truth finding techniques to paint the best picture of the problem so that you can begin to hypothesize a solution.</p>\n<h2>Wirecutting</h2>\n<p>After completing a phase of user research, the next task is not jumping into high-fidelity, pixel-perfect mockups. I'll coin the term &quot;<strong>wirecutting</strong>&quot; for when a designer cuts out this wireframing step to work on prettier things. Wireframing helps visualize the flow and features expected to support the user's goals. In this process, it is easy to see when cluttered interfaces appear and the priority of elements reevalutated. These are commonly without color and for good reason. If it doesn't work in black &amp; white, color isn't going to help. Putting gold leaf on a turd, is a really shiny turd.</p>\n<p>I believe in a world where wireframes are piped into a tool which creates high-fidelity mockups using the rules and guidance of a design system. Amazingly, this world is here in the form of <a href=\"https://uizard.io/\">Uizard</a>. Using this tool, designers can avoid the nuiances of following the system guidelines and focus on the experience by wireframing. The tool should handle the high-fidelity part of the handoff process. For some folks, this may take some of the fun out of the job. On the other hand, maybe the job was misunderstood in the first place.</p>\n<p>Of course this assumes a design system is well established. So let's now focus specifically in this area.</p>\n<h2>Budget crayon box</h2>\n<p>There's dozens of posts online about how color palettes were created for a design system (<a href=\"https://design.lyft.com/re-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88\">Lyft</a>, <a href=\"https://github.blog/2022-06-14-accelerating-github-theme-creation-with-color-tooling/\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://adobe.design/stories/design-for-scale/reinventing-adobe-spectrum-s-colors\">Adobe</a>). A great deal of talk about color theory and creating tools to help visualize curves of color for the perfect balance. I cannot deny that resulting palettes are often very beautiful and I often need to use the work of others in order to choose color due to my deficiency. However, <strong>how much of that palette do you really expect to use?</strong> This is the palette created by Ferdy Christant based on <a href=\"https://yeun.github.io/open-color/\">Open Color</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/color-challenged-palette.png\" alt=\"Large color palette\" /></p>\n<p>That's a lot of color.</p>\n<p>Let's first just talk about contrast which is a requirement to make something accessible. If you have several steps of color, I'd guess that many of the colors found within the middle of those steps have trouble being accessible with <em>most</em> colors in your palette. This is something that <a href=\"https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems\">the Stripe team found</a> while revisiting color for accessibility. It's very possible you could omit much from the middle of the palette to support accessible color choice.</p>\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://ferdychristant.com/color-for-the-color-challenged-884c7aa04a56\">Ferdy's post about working with the palette</a>, there is mention about the lack of accessibility in the palette.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://ferdychristant.com/color-for-the-color-challenged-884c7aa04a56\">\n<p>Open Color does not rank well when it comes to contrast. The root cause here is that we’re paying the price of beauty.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://ferdychristant.com/color-for-the-color-challenged-884c7aa04a56\"><cite>Ferdy Christant</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>You'll be paying for more than beauty if hit with <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/record-number-of-lawsuits-filed-over-accessibility-for-people-with-disabilities.aspx\">an accessibility lawsuit</a>. But Ferdy's answer is to add <em>more</em> color; 3 more dark tones to each hue. I don't agree with this suggestion because trying to choose the right color becomes a challenge when there are so many to choose from (ie., <a href=\"https://lawsofux.com/en/hicks-law/\">Hick's Law</a>). Limiting the selection drives consistency. I'll even go so far to say that it enhances creativity because you'll need to design within constraints which requires out-of-the-(crayon)-box thinking.</p>\n<h2>Coloring outside the lines</h2>\n<p>Past contrast, let's now talk about the application of color within an interface. If you look at many modern interface designs today, they tend to follow a 60/30/10 rule. Some sites like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a> even let you choose a few colors. This comes from interior design where you choose 3 colors and use them in percentages in your space. This is a loose rule, and <a href=\"https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/problems-with-the-60-30-10-rule-25206d02bbfd\">opponents of the rule</a> will call out several factors against it.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/problems-with-the-60-30-10-rule-25206d02bbfd\">\n<p>First, restricting a color palette to only three colors inhibits creative designs. While it prevents overstimulation, exploring more “rebellious” designs make brands stand out from their competitors.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/problems-with-the-60-30-10-rule-25206d02bbfd\"><cite>Catherine Rasgaitis</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>For the purpose of functional product design, I don't believe we should be striving for creativity in the application of color. Users are expecting familiar and accessible experiences. Painting with all of the colors of the wind will feel like navigating a rainbow hurricane. The limiting of this color helps set expectations as users achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>Even in interior design, the original birth of the rule, it is near impossible to strictly use only three colors. It isn't realistic. There will be additional hints of other colors outside the chosen selection for elements that make up a room. This is a photo of an actual room in the design systems house.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/ds-house-room.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of room using balanced color of interior design\" /></p>\n<p>White is a majority, blue is next most prominent, accents are orange-yellow. Importantly there are other colors too! The green plant, the teal footstools, even a rainbow legoset. Admittedly, the rule should probably be something like 55/25/15, which leaves an additional 5% of various colors not covered by the rule where applicable. For user interface design the majority of color will cover the background, the next most important color covers content, and the final most important covers accents that draw the user toward interactivity.</p>\n<p>So for most cases I believe you could probably design the large majority of an interface by having a palette of roughly 10 colors or less.</p>\n<h2>Cases for more crayons</h2>\n<p>An area where more colors are typically introduced are parts of an experience that are meant to indicate status. An error state is frequently shown in red. However, if the text describing the error is too small or thin to distinguish color, it could be missed as an error. Furthermore, the color red is prosperous in China. These are all reasons why we should not rely on color alone to indicate status. I recommend having two forms of status indication; one can be color where cultural sensitivity is considered and then some other pattern to support the status.</p>\n<p>Another area where color is used is to indicate deviations between near identical entities. This can commonly be found in elements like data visualizations (ie., charts) but can also be found when segregating users in a list of contacts. Changes of color here are meant to separate like items making the collection easier to scan.</p>\n<p>I can tell you from experience that I often have difficulty identifying the parts of a data visualization that relies on color to show data <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02696-z\">but don't take my word for it</a>. You can imagine how much harder it would be for a blind user to experience. This is again why more emphasis should be given toward presenting the data inclusively, perhaps using a table, and also include a progressive enhancement through a visualization. Putting the color before the data is only helpful for some; let's consider being help for all. The Carbon folks at IBM have more <a href=\"https://medium.com/carbondesign/color-palettes-and-accessibility-features-for-data-visualization-7869f4874fca\">tips to support data visualization for accessibility</a> and mention more work still needs to be done.</p>\n<h2>Finish with color</h2>\n<p>There is a reason why, when you apply stain to a table, the solution you apply is called the &quot;finish&quot;. It happens at the end of the building process. After all the plans are made, the legs cut and fastened, and the top made smooth do you finally apply the coloring. Color can bring the personality to an experience and to call something done. There can be an appropriate time to focus on this work but for the start, keep it simple and use design tokens to support changes for the future. Make color the finish to a usable product.</p>",

      "value": "<p>If you believe in free-will, options are most likely a foundational aspect of your philosophy. Designers are responsible for presenting choices to users so that they may select the best option and advance toward a goal. Historically, we have introduced several patterns which support the ability for users to make a choice. In this exploration we will consider some common interface components and understand why we might decide to use one over another.</p>\n<h2>Ground rules</h2>\n<p>The abstract concept we'll be focusing on is a group of similar items and the ways they can be presented and interacted. This means singular buttons and inline links aren't included in this exploration.</p>\n<p>The act of creating an option will also be avoided. Generally speaking, once the option is created, it'll be included within the existing presentational group of options using one of the approaches described. An example of this might be creating a post category for use in tagging entries in a blog.</p>\n<p>While important, this exploration will not be focusing on the curation of the content within an option. Certainly, poor choices in wording or inaccessible options will inhibit the user from making the best choice. The following exploration assumes options are well-crafted.</p>\n<h2>Definitions</h2>\n<p>The following patterns will be referenced throughout this exploration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/commandbar\">Button groups</a>: Examples are found in word processing tools for selecting text alignment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/radio-group/\">Radio button groups</a>: Examples are found in online surveys to rate quality of service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/CheckboxGroup.html\">Checkbox groups</a>: Examples are found in selecting options to filter products.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/select/usage\">Native HTML select options</a>: Examples are found when selecting locations from a list.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://baseweb.design/components/header-navigation/\">Navigational menus</a>: Examples are found in the header of marketing sites.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://v2.grommet.io/menu\">Context menus</a>: Examples are found as right-click to copy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newskit.co.uk/components/tabs/\">Tab groups</a>: Examples are found within web pages as secondary navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Button group confusion</h3>\n<p>What I've defined as button group above is not a common button group <a href=\"https://component.gallery/components/button-group/\">found amongst most design systems</a>. The key difference here is the keyboard navigation. A button group is often delivered as just a layout pattern of existing buttons with very little change of visual style and no change in interaction pattern. Each button is accessible via the <code>Tab</code> key like any other button that isn't in a group. Because of this, I identify these as groups of individual buttons. There's nothing stopping most systems to allow any sort of interactive component to exist in these groups; like links for example. For this I recommend providing a layout component instead of something specific for buttons.</p>\n<p>However, I am specifically calling out the pattern found in toolbars as it is expected to be a single tab stop, where navigation between buttons is done by arrow keys. Visually these are groups of buttons but with a different and warranted enhancement for accessibility. This pattern can also be found in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/\">listboxes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/\">comboboxes</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubutton/\">menus</a> which also expect arrow key navigation between options within a single tab stop. A <a href=\"https://component.gallery/components/segmented-control/\">segmented control</a> is also of the same family but more related to radio buttons.</p>\n<p>To reiterate, this behavior is not meant for usage with most groups of buttons found within an interface, as each is commonly expected to be an individual tab stop.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>It's also important to define a few terms used for accessibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tab stop</strong>: An area of the interface which is focused by the <code>Tab</code> key where additional actions can occur. Links and text input fields are clear tab stop examples, but entire lists of options can also be defined as a single tab stop. The area that should be identified as a tab stop is achieved through accessibility best practices for an experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Roving tabindex</strong>: A technique to show focus on an element without the use of the <code>Tab</code> key. This is done by toggling the <code>tabIndex</code> of interactive elements. One element in the list will receive a <code>tabIndex=&quot;0&quot;</code>, while the rest receive <code>tabIndex=&quot;-1&quot;</code>. This allows the user to re-enter the area using the <code>Tab</code> key and return focus back to the previously focused element. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCIC2LNt0bk&amp;t=6s\">Here's a video explaining the technique by Rob Dodson</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Accessibility is not easy</h3>\n<p>There's a great deal of nuance when attempting to make options accessible. While the w3 attempts to provide <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/\">guidance on best practices</a>, achieving intended results can be challenging. For example, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#x6-6-2-managing-focus-in-composites-using-aria-activedescendant\">the guidelines claim</a> the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a component container has an ARIA role that supports the <code>aria-activedescendant</code> property, it is not necessary to manipulate the tabindex attribute and move DOM focus among focusable elements within the container.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://zellwk.com/blog/element-focus-vs-aria-activedescendant/\">testing completed by Zell Liew</a> concluded that <code>aria-activedescendant</code> is not well supported for assistive technologies. It's important to put your best efforts toward marking the options for visibiity to all users and their methods of interaction.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<h2>Instant gratification</h2>\n<p>One of the attributes of making a selection is the immediate result of the interaction. Patterns that show new content based on the selection are commonly immediate. For example, navigational menus which redirect to new content should be instant. Buttons that update state like deleting a row of data are also expected to happen quickly.</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to options which expect a user to make selections and then commit those selections in a final action. This is commonly form elements such as radio buttons, checkboxes and HTML selects. The user will choose these options but no updates to the larger system will be made until the user sends a final command. This is often the case for wizard experiences also, where the act of going to the next step submits the options selected before traversing further.</p>\n<p>This means we can divide the patterns into some groups:</p>\n<div data-density-shift=\"\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instantaneous</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Button groups</li>\n<li>Navigational menus</li>\n<li>Context menus</li>\n<li>Tab groups</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Confirmational</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Radio button groups</li>\n<li>Checkbox groups</li>\n<li>Native HTML select options</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>Links vs Buttons</h2>\n<p>Full disclosure, I am a big proponent for clarity of intent. I believe links should have an underline and navigate to new pages, allowing for all the default behaviors an <code>&lt;a/&gt;</code> tag provides. Buttons should have visible padding and execute actions on the current page, allowing for all the default behaviors a <code>&lt;button/&gt;</code> tag provides. With that out of the way, there's additional level of consideration for the difference.</p>\n<p>Links (<code>&lt;a/&gt;</code> elements) are meant to be individual tab stops <em>always</em>. This means that if the link is meant to be navigational and sends the user to a new page, the user should be able to go to this element using just the <code>Tab</code> key.</p>\n<p>For buttons (<code>&lt;button/&gt;</code> elements), this isn't the case when prepared as a proper group of related controls. The group is expected to be a single tab stop. Once within the tab stop, a roving tabindex pattern is used to traverse the controls.</p>\n<p>This is a good place to introduce the tab user interface pattern which commonly is treated to look like manilla folder tabs. If the tab interface you prepare expects each tab to be a navigational link that can be revisited using the browser's URL bar, this means that each tab is an individual tab stop; as link behavior is expected. On the other hand, if each tab is meant to execute a command, thereby keeping the user on the same page, then the entire tab group is one tab stop with roving tabindex navigation. In this way the tab pattern can either act as a navigational menu (using links), or a button group (using buttons). The main decision goes back to the links versus buttons debate to decide which experience to use.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Etymology of tab</h3>\n<p>Tangentially, the word tab has two definitions for this exploration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tab (n.)</strong>: a second or further document or page that can be opened on a spreadsheet or web browser. Compare also Middle English <em>tab</em> &quot;strap or string&quot; (mid-15c.), Norwegian dialectal <em>tave</em> &quot;piece of cloth, rag.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Tab (v.)</strong>: to press the tab key on a computer or typewriter. As a short form of <em>tabulator key</em> of a typewriter (later computer) it is recorded from 1916.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Confusingly, you often do not move between tabs using the tab key. Such is the wonderful world of English and computer interfaces.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Let's continue to group our patterns:</p>\n<div data-density-shift=\"\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instantaneous</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Navigational</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigational menus</li>\n<li>Tab groups*</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Functional</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Button groups</li>\n<li>Context menus</li>\n<li>Tab groups*</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Confirmational</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Radio button groups</li>\n<li>Checkbox groups</li>\n<li>Native HTML select options</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>Confirmation follows form</h2>\n<p>Returning to the confirmational group, these are patterns most commonly found in forms. This aligns to the way which we would fill out paper forms by entering in all the information first before submitting.</p>\n<p>One of the most clear indications of usage between these patterns of the group is between checkboxes and radio buttons. Checkboxes are meant for selecting more than one option, while radio buttons are used for selecting a single exclusive option.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Keyboard interactivity differences</h3>\n<p>Another important difference between checkbox and radio groups is the tab stops. Each checkbox is a single tab stop, while an entire group of radio buttons is a single tab stop with arrow key navigation. This is built into HTML as long as the <code>name</code> property is correctly applied.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Interestingly, the native HTML select allows for both configurations (using the <code>multiple</code> attribute for multiple selections). So the question is, why use the native HTML select when there are other patterns which more clear usage?</p>\n<p>One of the properties of the HTML select is the limited amount of data shown. The element is restrictive to a word or phrase which represents the value for selection. The other patterns allow for much more information. In relation, the select only displays the selected value. This means that it is less likely that the user will review the selection since it requires extra interaction. Laying out all the options as checkboxes or radio buttons help the user consider all the possibilities. Additionally, the HTML select options are not bound to the page layout; its options will exist separately from visual flow. This supports the basis of using checkboxes and radios for options which need more detail from options that are concise.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<h3>Multiple problems</h3>\n<p>The <code>multiple</code> attribute which could be added to the HTML select is not a common pattern in user interface design. On desktop devices, additional keys must be introduced in order to choose multiple options and the keys to use vary between desktop operating systems (<code>Ctrl</code> (windows) or <code>Cmd</code> (Mac)). Touch devices commonly provide these as checkboxes instead which helps users identify the ability to choose more than one. Due to these properties I would recommend avoiding the HTML select for choosing multiple options and instead present a list of checkboxes or a similar but consistent pattern.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Let's break down the options one more time:</p>\n<div data-density-shift=\"\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instantaneous</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Navigational</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigational menus</li>\n<li>Tab groups*</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Functional</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Button groups</li>\n<li>Context menus</li>\n<li>Tab groups*</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Confirmational</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Verbose</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exclusive</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Radio button groups</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkbox groups</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Concise</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Native HTML select options</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>Flow</h2>\n<p>Here's a visual representation of our decision tree:</p>\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">  graph TD&#10;    A[Give user a choice]&#10;    A --&gt; B{Happens immediately?}&#10;    B --&gt;|Yes| C[Instantaneous]&#10;    B --&gt;|No| D[Confirmational]&#10;    C --&gt; E{Directed to new page?}&#10;    E --&gt;|Yes| F[Navigational]&#10;    E --&gt;|No| G[Functional]&#10;    D --&gt; H{Include considerations?}&#10;    H --&gt;|Yes| I[Verbose]&#10;    H --&gt;|No| J[Concise]&#10;</pre>\n<p>The flow chart above can help lead a path toward a decision by asking <strong>why</strong>...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why does the user need the action to happen immediately?</li>\n<li>Why does the user need to remain on the page?</li>\n<li>Why does the user need more information about this choice?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adding purpose to these decisions will ultimately support design decisions with clarity. You can be confident that the pattern chosen is the best one based on the answers to these questions.</p>\n<h2>Unavailable options</h2>\n<p>A pattern that may be examined is disabling an option. This could occur because the user hasn't satisfied criteria or the system is not yet prepared to offer the option. Opinions vary about the decision of showing options that the user is unable to select. I believe the following questions can determine if showing a option as disabled is helpful to the user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will the option be available to the user if criteria are met?</li>\n<li>Are the criteria for the option clearly shown in context of the option?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the answer to the questions are &quot;yes&quot; then it may be appropriate to disable the option. However, note that disabled options aren't detectable to screen readers and commonly lack sufficient color contrast. Providing the criteria for enabling the option will support these deficits. <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/frustrating-design-patterns-disabled-buttons/\">Vitaly Friedman goes into greater detail at Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>\n<p>To put it simply, if it isn't important why include it in the experience? This segues into the next topic.</p>\n<h2>Abundant options</h2>\n<p>Presenting the user with too many options introduces a cognitive load and decision paralysis. As described by <a href=\"https://lawsofux.com/en/hicks-law/\">Hick's Law</a>, the more choices you present, the longer it will take to reach a decision. This might include halting the current flow to return to at a later time. In contrast, limiting the number of options will improve the user experience. While some patterns expect to provide dozens of choices (eg. country of origin), there might be better design choices to capture the same information (eg. text field filtering of the list).</p>\n<p>Use empathy to drive your design choices and your users will be thankful.</p>",

      "value": "<p>It's my birthday today, 40 times around the sun. I reflect back to the first time I started journaling; it was on my IBM computer in a text file I called &quot;hyperjournal&quot;. I really tried to be regular about it but just fell out of habit. Fast forward to now and it's been 4 months since my last post but not for lack of effort.</p>\n<h2>Complementary Space</h2>\n<p>A topic that I've <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/spacing-solved\">written about on my blog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2P-Bhbcj9k\">spoke about at a conference earlier this year</a> is a new way to think of spacing tokens called <a href=\"https://complementary.space/\">Complementary Space</a>. It's the follow-up to <a href=\"https://gridless.design/\">Gridless Design</a> which got a great deal of interest last year. Complementary Space has gotten a bit less attention but I think that's understandable because it is experimental and not strictly design token based. It needs a different kind of mindset to fully embrace. Releasing it so close to the holidays was also probably bad timing. However, I appreciate all of the feedback I've received on it.</p>\n<h2>Connecting with community</h2>\n<p>So. many. design systems events. In the past few months I attended Schema and Clarity along with a dozen video conference events. The latest was <a href=\"https://www.supernova.io/future-of-design-tokens\">a fully stacked panel speaking about the future of design tokens</a> yesterday, and there's <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/unconference-a-maturity-model-for-design-systems-registration-446204027257\">another event today</a> (that I unfortunately must miss). I love how active this community is, where there is always a discussion to be had. I'm especially glad for the wrap up of yesterday's panel where the leadership agreed that there's a future where we <em>aren't</em> pushing pixels or making buttons because it's already done. This gives us time to focus on what really matters; <strong>the experience</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is absolutely a world where design systems is not about the assets but about the infrastructure. I got an opportunity to catch up with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunbent\">Shaun Bent</a> of Spotify who had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xww-x7DgiDw\">a talk</a> a few years ago describing their onion model where a core system supports outer systems. This is where the future of design systems is for me; people who focus on the infrastructure of how resources are delivered across teams. We spoke a bit about the TV team for Spotify since it is especially niche and how the fit into the support strucuture. A question I had was &quot;would it be more beneficial to have a representative of the TV team on the design system team?&quot; Both of us don't know what the answer to that is. There are pros and cons either way. For right now as I understand it, the TV team there is specialized and meets regularly with the design system team for alignment. Though I think these are questions we should be asking, not what is another way of displaying a token library.</p>\n<p>I absolutely love chatting with members of the design system community about these kinds of questions and topics.</p>\n<h2>Redesign</h2>\n<p>When I first launched this blog I didn't put a lot of effort into the design because I expected folks to <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/feed.xml\">subscribe to the RSS feed</a>. However, every time I'd look at this blog, I'd be so bored with the design of it. It wasn't reflecting my personality and I wasn't sure what direction to go. After playing around a bit and speaking with <a href=\"https://jennifer.damato.design/\">Jen</a> on this; she recommended that I lean harder into the hot takes and use <a href=\"https://firstwefeast.com/tag/hot-ones\">Hot Ones</a> as inspiration. I'm glad there's another designer living with me to help get out of designers-block. 😅</p>\n<p>So now I rate each post with a <code>heat</code> which will inform the accent color used on the post; from mild to volcanic. This isn't visible at all in the feeds, but for those visiting the site it'll be a nice bit of personality. Most of the colors being generated are accessible but I'm looking forward to the new color space functions in CSS to get further accessibility support. Jen also had the idea to have folks reading posts to influence the heat but I'm not about to hook this up to a custom database and authentication just for a single value.</p>\n<p>I've also updated the OG image generation to use <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/satori\">Satori</a> by way of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-og-image\"><code>eleventy-plugin-og-image</code></a>, making it much easier to create images for each post. I hope there's better support for CSS in the future with this tool but it does a good enough job for easy integration.</p>\n<p>I also want to put a bit of animation into the new neon synthwave effect for the titles but that'll take a bit of time and exploration.</p>\n<h2>Plans for next year</h2>\n<p>I have another large project that I started last year based on a short conversation with <a href=\"https://danmall.com/\">Dan Mall</a>. It'll probably take a long time to officially announce since there's a lot of work to be done for it. In the meantime I still expect to create posts here on a better cadence. I have over a dozen post ideas ready to be written.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I'm planning to put more focus on Mastodon and less in other social media platforms. I'm still not comfortable with the new platform because at the moment the circles are small. I hope more folks join for more connections to be made and that finding like interests is easier. However, it's better than having notifications of suggested posts that are completely irrelevant to my interests like most other social platforms. So if you're following me at the birdsite, I recommend you consider <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-started-use-mastodon/\">coming over to Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://social.design.systems/@donnie\">following me there</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to what the next 40 years may bring!</p>",

      "value": "<p>In my teens, I was involved in many extra-curricular activities in high school. I was president of the art club for all 4 years and lead for the school's robotics team. While I wasn't officially part of the class counsel, due to my volunteer work especially with the homecoming floats, I was given a new title by my peers over 20 years ago; <strong>Design Engineer</strong>.</p>\n<p>I didn't think much of it then but after being fully immersed in both design and engineering, I resonate with that title. Not only do I consider how an experience could be constructed; I actually construct it. That's something that's always been important to me. Just having the idea wasn't good enough, I needed to <em>show</em> people the concept and it wouldn't be complete unless it was the real deal.</p>\n<h2>Getting paid</h2>\n<p>It's one thing to find your passion, it's another thing for that passion to put bread on the table. My passion didn't start doing that until after graduating college. My first engineering job was officially as the sole frontend engineer for a finacial tech company but they also didn't have a designer. My co-workers saw how quickly I could prototype a design in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a> and made it easy to collaborate, so they gave me the responsibility for the design of the platform too. That's where I took on both roles but also had both titles; Product Designer &amp; Frontend Engineer.</p>\n<p>After that role, I was hired at a real estate startup as a Frontend Engineer. The codebase was massive, they were using a framework I've never seen, and my onboarding buddy was assigned to a totally different team working on the launch of what would become the most successful product on the platform. It was a sea of anxiety and I had a metric ton of imposter syndrome. However, as timing would have it, they also hired a new Director of UX and we were in many of the same onboarding groups. I raised the idea of joining their team to help with prototyping and better integration of design into code and after some formalities, that's how I became their first UX Engineer.</p>\n<p>I felt really relieved. Design was straightforward for me and I could ease my way into the codebase with small changes instead of feeling responsibility for the entire repository of code at once. Like many places, onboarding is not often crafted well because it's done once and the business has other higher priorities. More on that later.</p>\n<h2>Rainbows &amp; roses</h2>\n<p>Most of my first responsibilities were to prototype experiences to hand off for research studies. I quickly found that I was reusing the same assets over and over so I started making my own little library of components in CodePen. I could import files across pens by <a href=\"https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/url-extensions/\">appending the file type to the end of the url</a>. While there was an existing component library; these designs were often new and experimental. I needed my own collection of components that I could iterate on in isolation for these prototypes.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I became more comfortable with the codebase and found areas of improvement; especially when it came to CSS. I found out then that most engineers have difficulty with CSS. For me, CSS came naturally and I was able to do things that didn't seem possible for others. As one example, there was an ask from design to pin the footer to the bottom of our listing results. The listing results component was using a collection of CSS overrides on <a href=\"https://www.ag-grid.com/\">AG Grid</a>, and the architecture of those overrides were outlined in a multi-page document. It was a big deal to even look at the project, let alone change it. The lead engineer for the frontend team told management a change like this would take 6 weeks.</p>\n<p>I made the changes over 6 days.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I was responsible for all CSS found on the platform. While I wasn't looking at every PR, I was always called into the room for large projects or complex experiences. The listing details page was one of my last large influences; which was one of the first places where I was able to use <code>display: grid;</code> and <code>position: sticky;</code> on a production site. I became responsible for the component library, as it eventually matured into a design system. By the end of my time, I was putting together the Design System team and looking into how we could support all the various frameworks being used with a singular source of truth.</p>\n<h2>Managing expectations</h2>\n<p>While I loved all the work I was involved in, there was one thing that made me leave; lack of recognition. Many people were promoted during my tenure; I've seen some people promoted 3 times during my 2+ years there. I was promoted only once and it was title change with a cost of living pay increase. A few months later we'd have a new CTO and start new tech hubs around the world. What happened? Why was I left in the cold when everyone else was shining?</p>\n<p>When I first became a UX Engineer, I was reporting under the design organization. The trouble here was that our Director of UX didn't have experience managing an engineer before. While this autonomy felt good to me, there was no career ladder. It wasn't clear what steps I needed to take to be promoted. After the director left, I was reporting to the principle designer who really didn't want to manage people.</p>\n<p>It was around this time the most senior frontend engineers were convincing me to come back into the engineering organization; right on the heels of the AG Grid work mentioned earlier. With some help from a new engineering manager willing to take me on, I moved back into the engineering organization. That manager was a huge help for my career because he understood my skills and influence and was able to be my voice in rooms I couldn't be in. He was the person who fought for my promotion, just before he was pushed out by management.</p>\n<p>I was reporting under a new manager then; someone who previously identified as a backend engineer. It felt like I was reporting under the design team again. For our mandatory 1:1, he'd ask how I was doing and I'd just telling what I was working on. He really couldn't give me much feedback because he didn't know my world. It wasn't really his fault; we were just paired poorly.</p>\n<p>When the new CTO came, we had a large restructuring which included new VPs of Engineering and other managers. After stating a case that I was a leader in the engineering organization, instead of receiving a promotion, I was restructured to report under one of the new VPs of Engineering. He really didn't have any time for me; trying to get up to speed on larger problems that were happening with hyper growth. After having 6 managers and the company removing the only one that really helped me; I decided if I was going to grow, it couldn't be here.</p>\n<h2>Picking a side</h2>\n<p>After I left, I joined the company I currently work for. Here, the management understands my value and every person I've reported to can hold in-depth conversations about my areas of interest and provides meaningful feedback. It's really what I've been looking for all along. There's only one problem:</p>\n<p>My role is Software Engineer.</p>\n<p>What's the difference? As a Software Engineer, you're expected to just live in the code. You rarely get a glimpse into the experience design side of feature development and instead need to be responsible for lots of different engineered systems; databasing, CI/CD, bundling configurations, along with feature development. All the problems you solve have to do with getting the computer to do what you want with commands. As a UX Engineer, you are responsible for the user experience. The problems you are solving are user needs and (in my opinion) much more interesting and impactful.</p>\n<p>I don't associate with being a Software Engineer. I associate with being a UX Engineer. However, because UX Engineering doesn't have the career support that Software Engineering does; I need to masquerade as something I'm not just to succeed in a field and have a possibility of promotion.</p>\n<p>This isn't only where I work. The industry has a clear problem supporting UX Engineering. Often a company has a UX Engineering role but reports under either design or engineering. This will often lead to the problems I've personally experienced shown above; lack of understanding about the role for existing management. On the other hand, folks picking a side can struggle because they don't have all the knowledge or experience as other folks with roles aligned to the larger organization. In other words, a designer probably knows all the hidden gems in Figma; while a UX Engineer might only know some intermediate techniques. Without clear responsibilities; the UX Engineer will look subpar to the Designer. In my case, I'm not able to effortlessly debug workflow problems for CI/CD and unfortunately that sounds like something a Software Engineer should do.</p>\n<p>This is all assuming you were hired. The interview process can be especially disappointing for a UX Engineer. We're often met with teams of Full Stack engineers who gang up on us to determine how much we don't know about the stack. What good does knowing how to use Auto Layout in Figma do if you can't even query a database?</p>\n<h2>Outlook</h2>\n<p>As an industry we should provide more support in UX Engineering. Even if there aren't defined management positions leading UX Engineering in an organization; existing leadership should recognize this role and help define a path with folks that have these specialized skills; highlighting their abilities. These are the folks who translate design into code <em>without</em> looking at the inspect panel. If you don't see the benefit of that; I'm afraid you really don't know how the web works.</p>\n<p>For my fellow UX Engineers out there, my heart goes out to you. I hope you're being recognized for the work you're doing; either by compensation, role, or fulfilling work. I wish I knew how to take the mask off. If you find out, please let me know.</p>",

      "value": "<p>You've seen it before, an 'x' at the corner of a surface which will allow the user to exit that surface. In design, it seems simple to just place the button at the top corner. To engineer this, we have a few options:</p>\n<h2>Absolute Position</h2>\n<p>The first option most folks might consider is something like the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.surface</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">position</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> relative<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token selector\">.surface button.close</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">position</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> absolute<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token comment\">/* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties */</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">inset-block-start</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* logical property for \"top\" */</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">inset-inline-end</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* logical property for \"right\" */</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Many design system component libraries use this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ant.design/components/modal\">Ant Design System</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://baseweb.design/components/modal/\">Base Web (Uber)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/code/\">Carbon Design System (IBM)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/modal/usage\">Chakra UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://primer.style/react/Dialog\">Github Primer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reach.tech/dialog/\">Reach UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.design/product/components/modals/\">Stacks (StackOverflow)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem with this approach is the way that <code>position: absolute</code> works. When applying <code>position: absolute;</code> to an element, it takes that element out of the normal flow of the document. This means that other elements cannot interact with this element.</p>\n<p>In some configurations for the above components, the content (usually the title) <em>could</em> appear visually layered below the close button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/modal-button-collide.png\" alt=\"Curated text that visually collides with the close button in Github Primer\" /></p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"warning\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>Even if you think you control the content, assume that you don't. User preferences can influence the content display, either by size, translation, or otherwise. Be prepared for the content to vary.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Some implementations solve this for by providing enough padding to the content area so the button never collides. However, this often results in an imbalance of padding and may not be desirable from design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/modal-padding-imbalance.png\" alt=\"Text never touches the far edge because there's more padding for the close button in IBM Carbon\" /></p>\n<h2>Flex header</h2>\n<p>Another method is to add the button as a flex child to a header of the surface.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.surface .header</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">display</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> flex<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token selector\">.surface .header button.close</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">margin-inline-start</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> auto<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Here's a list of components across design systems using this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://atlassian.design/components/modal-dialog/examples\">Atlassian Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/modal\">Microsoft Fluent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://paste.twilio.design/components/modal/\">Twilio Paste</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://polaris.shopify.com/components/modal#navigation\">Shopify Polaris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shoelace.style/components/dialog\">Shoelace UI</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While this avoids a collision between the button and content, it also requires that the header exist which will be at least the height of the close button. In cases where additional header content doesn't exist this displays a large forehead before the content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/modal-large-forehead.png\" alt=\"Removing title results in large space above the content in Twilio Paste\" /></p>\n<p>So if the surface doesn't have a title, the amount of space might not be desirable by design. Certainly, if design is attempting to curate the title, this might have some control. However, incorrect alignment could also result in the close button centering within the header instead of pinning to the corner.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/modal-centered-header.png\" alt=\"A large amount of header content can visually center button in Shoelace UI\" /></p>\n<h2>Unique alternatives</h2>\n<p>There are some other approaches. <a href=\"https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/modals/\">Salesforce Lightning includes the button outside the modal</a> which might not work for other surfaces. <a href=\"https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components/alert/\">Their alert component</a> uses the <code>position: absolute;</code> technique as an example which will have similar problems as described above. <a href=\"https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/alert-dialog/\">Adobe Spectrum avoids the 'x' button entirely</a> and provides an explicit action to close the surface. However, <a href=\"https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/in-line-alert/\">their alert component</a> suffers from problems using the icon accessory in relation to the title in this similar layout.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/modal-alert-icon.png\" alt=\"A large amount of header content can shrink the icon in Adobe Spectrum\" /></p>\n<h2>The &quot;buoyant&quot; approach</h2>\n<p>Let's be clear about some requirements. If design is expecting a close button to appear at the top corner:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Padding around the surface should be visually consistent.</li>\n<li>The close button should never move from the corner.</li>\n<li>The content in the surface should not collide with the close button.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>These requirements are meant for surfaces that are text heavy. A surface which has a full-bleed media (eg., image or video) which spans the width of the surface will have other problems. The normal <code>position: absolute;</code> treatment would probably work well in this case and then ensuring that the button has sufficient contrast against the media it appears above.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>We can leverage two features of CSS to get an intended result.</p>\n<h3>Recent relative ancestor</h3>\n<p>In order to get an element to be positioned relative to another, we need to create a relationship. In the case of <code>position: absolute;</code> this relation doesn't need to be between a direct parent and child. It can be <strong>any ancestor</strong>. This means we can have a distant child be positioned to ancestor located up the tree.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.surface</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">position</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> relative<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token selector\">.surface button.close</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">position</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> absolute<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>This is no different from the methods we've critized above <em>except</em> that the <code>button.close</code> element is a child of another element; our secret sauce...</p>\n<h3>Floats!</h3>\n<p>The way we get text to wrap around elements is by using  the <code>float</code> property. We'll float the button toward the right, so that content moves around it.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">span.floater</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">float</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> right<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* inline-end */</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>While we'd like to use CSS Logical Properties for the float, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float#browser_compatibility\">they aren't well supported</a>. You'll probably need to adjust the type of float based on the <code>dir</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">[dir=\"rtl\"] span.floater</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">float</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> left<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Then our HTML should be setup in the following manner:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>surface<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>span</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>floater<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>close<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>×<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Surface content goes here --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>You'll need a bunch of other styles to finesse the size of the floating element and button in relation to the content. The final result should look something like this:</p>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"buoyant button\" src=\"https://codepen.io/fauxserious/embed/ExpWjzL?default-tab=html%2Cresult&editable=true\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n  See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/fauxserious/pen/ExpWjzL\">\n  buoyant button</a> by Donnie D'Amato (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/fauxserious\">@fauxserious</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<p>Let me explain what's going on here. In the demo above, the blue box represents the <code>span.floater</code> element dimensions. Note that because we're using <code>position: absolute;</code> for the <code>button</code> element child, it's not visually inside the <code>span.floater</code> but instead positioned relative to the surface. We set the dimensions of the <code>span.floater</code> so that the content won't collide with the dimensions of the <code>button</code> and instead wraps around it.</p>\n<p>You can remove the <code>demo</code> attribute from the <code>&lt;closable-surface/&gt;</code> element to see the final result without the blue box. I'm using a custom element so that it is easy to edit the content without accidentally altering the markup meant for the buoyant button.</p>\n<p>Try removing the title, editing the content, or resizing the window. The content should never collide with the button and always sit at the top corner.</p>\n<p><strong>#make-floats-great-again</strong></p>",

Perhaps a white background with nearly black text. There's a section in this UI that you want to have a stark contrast with the rest of the page.

The button has all the same properties that other buttons in the system have, except it's located on this dark background.</p>\n<p>Most folks might have a button prepared specifically for this scenario.

But unfortunately you might see a problem begin to appear.</p>\n<p>The problem is that for every UI element that <em>might</em> appear in this section in the future, you'd need to define an entire new set of tokens to describe the color for that UI. This is especially exhausting since you've already defined tokens semanitcally for all of these things in the &quot;default&quot; environment. To fully cover the dark area, you'd need to <strong>double the amount of token names</strong> to include the additional &quot;ondark&quot; (or &quot;inverse&quot;, &quot;reverse&quot;, &quot;contrast&quot;) infix.</p>\n<p>No bueno.</p>\n<h2>Remedy</h2>\n<h3>Semantic tokens</h3>\n<p>The first step is fully investing in semantic tokens. <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/tokens-as-intents\">I've called them &quot;intents&quot;</a> in the past to further enforce the expectation that the name describes purpose over value. We're talking about token names like <code>--button-background</code> or <code>--input-focused-critical-border-color</code> which give information about the component or pattern and the property being influenced. In no way does it give any information about what the value of this color is. The more you avoid encoding the value in the name, the more flexible your system will be with the opportunity for that color to change in the future.</p>\n<p>This extends to any token; describe the purpose and avoid the value when naming.</p>\n<h3>Scoped themes</h3>\n<p>A theme is the collection of values assigned to semantic tokens. The semantic tokens are a contract that should have permanence and meet expectations of folks building UI over time. These are the tokens that appear on the <em>left-side</em> of a theme. The values that would appear on the <em>right-side</em> can and should have a separate stakeholder, most likely one that represents a brand. I recommend avoiding managing both sides if possible to not introduce subjective bias or confusion in token naming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/token-responsibility.png\" alt=\"Be responsible for the left side theme assignment, avoid the right side\" /></p>\n<p>I cannot stress enough, <strong>how values are assigned on the right-side does not matter</strong>. Values can be referenced, hard-coded, computed, or otherwise because they should never be used directly within the UI. A color palette is influenced by the brand and determines what <code>--brand-blue-500</code> means. Here, the brand is responsible for curating the right-side values and how they are finally assigned to the left-side.</p>\n<p>The design system team is responsible for maintaining consistency on the left-side; that's it. They should only focus on the semantic token names for those values to be assigned and how they might support describing the experience at scale.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"warning\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>While I advocate for design systems folks to be hands-off for the right-side of the theme, it is not possible to be completely ignorant of what happens there. We should be providing guidance on best practices when curating the other side, especially in terms of accessibility. We should provide feedback when people attempt to choose color combinations that have low contrast or font-sizes that are illegible.</p>\n<p>And certainly when posed with limited resources, it's entirely possible for the design system team to manage both sides. But if you can avoid it, it's one less thing to be responsible for.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>Note that for simplicity the idea of &quot;dark-mode&quot; is also well represented by providing a dark theme. A user preference for &quot;high-contrast mode&quot; is asking for a high-contrast theme. The mode is the user preference. The theme is a collection of value assignments that aim to satisfy the mode.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Now for the key insight — instead of the dark area and the light colored page needing to be informed by a single theme, <strong>think of the dark area as an entirely separate theme</strong>. In this way, the values that represent <code>--button-background</code> can change depending on scope.</p>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"ondark\" src=\"https://codepen.io/fauxserious/embed/jOpmGbR?default-tab=html%2Cresult&editable=true\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n  See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/fauxserious/pen/jOpmGbR\">\n  ondark</a> by Donnie D'Amato (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/fauxserious\">@fauxserious</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No additional configuration at the component level.</strong> You don't need to remember or even know that this button is on a &quot;dark&quot; surface.</li>\n<li><strong>No additional token names.</strong> Self explanatory, naming is hard and scaling those names is even harder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the only name you need is the one describing the theme; &quot;dark&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Prescription</h2>\n<p>This still requires the design token values to be curated to account for a dark UI. If you worried about defining an entire new theme worth of tokens, start small. Only define the ones you need at first; maybe background, text and button. At some point you might have the resources to define it all and then you'll have an entire new theme to try.</p>\n<p>I've considered going farther, specifically with surfaces that expect to demonstrate feedback (eg., warning banner). You might imagine this banner similar to the dark section above with a text lockup and action to take. I say if you have the resources to prepare this as a theme, go for it! You'll be better prepared for when code samples might appear within the notification. Otherwise, you'll need to be highly restrictive to the kinds of content that appear within various colored surfaces. And we all know how much designers love restrictions. 😉</p>\n<p>It's possible to over compensate. As an example I wouldn't recommend creating a separate theme for inline feedback elements. Badges, notification dots, and error text can and should also be handled semantically inside a normal theme. Just think of a newsletter signup in a dark section; it should have an error message if the input isn't valid. If you think in surfaces, like a sub-artboard, then you'll better identify when a scoped theme would help.</p>\n<p>This new recommendation also requires that the system delivering themes be flexible enough to request more than one. I think there's an opportunity for some optimization here as well; where we statically analyze the page for tokens used within scopes and only serve what's needed. However, to start you could just import the theme when a scope is added. The benefit of this is if the scoped theme hasn't been included or the scope hasn't been applied, it'll fallback to the base theme values instead.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>body</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>This button has a black background<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>section</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">data-theme</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>dark<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />        <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Missing definition for the dark theme, <br />        everything here inherits from the light theme --></span><br />        <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>This button has a black background<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>section</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\n<p>If you're already using the &quot;ondark&quot; naming convention, it'll be hard to move to this new system. That goes for any semantic token that was expected for public use. Deprecating tokens at the semantic tier is very difficult because they could be used anywhere across the platform.</p>\n<p>Luckily there's a path forward:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you can setup the scopes and apply within the UI in the appropriate locations, making note of the UI elements that exist in those locations.</li>\n<li>Then define the values for those themes, perhaps reading from the &quot;ondark&quot; values.</li>\n<li>Start serving those themes to the pages, which will be inert at first because no UI elements should reference the tokens.</li>\n<li>Finally, either remove the component configuration that applies the dark theme or remove the &quot;ondark&quot; token assignments for the more generic tokens.</li>\n<li>You can now safely remove the &quot;ondark&quot; token virus from your system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I wish you best of luck in your path toward recovery.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT (2023-01-12):</strong> <a href=\"https://desandro.com/\">Dave</a> posted a great question as a follow-up and it deserves addressing.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://twitter.com/desandro/status/1613568348331155456\">\n<p>I'm curious how you would accommodate session-level Dark Mode?

For the purposes of this demonstration, it was more helpful to use the word &quot;dark&quot; to further cement what was happening within the scope. In practice, the scope should be described with some meaning or purpose for the change in scope over expected appearance. For the examples above, the &quot;light&quot; theme could instead be the &quot;base&quot; theme as it is meant to be the default. The &quot;dark&quot; theme could be &quot;feature&quot; theme as it is meant to highlight features (in our examples).</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span

definitely not solving this. For scoped themes, it's complex but not impossible. During the first pass, I recommend leaving user preference out to keep the execution simple but plan for it in a future implementation.</p>\n<p>If it was only as easy as <code>body { filter: invert(1); }</code>!</p>",

While this could just be more fuel to the fire, I hope this will be evergreen and reflect on any similar approaches that are developed over time. This also has the benefit of avoiding the name of any single framework in particular and instead comment on the direction as a whole.</p>\n<h2>Lightbulb moment</h2>\n<p>Recently, I realized exactly why I was aversed to utility class resources after watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZwlzOUOZ4\">Fireship.io's video</a> responding to the recent debates. The lightbulb lit for me specifically at this quote.</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZwlzOUOZ4\">\n<p>The benefit is that you don't have all these arbitrary classnames anymore and know exactly which styles apply to it.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZwlzOUOZ4\"><cite>Fireship.io</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p><strong>#naming-is-hard</strong> strikes again. There's two parts in the quote that I'll touch upon.</p>\n<h3>Knowing styles exactly</h3>\n<p><strong>Declarative classnames are not scalable.</strong> In a world where we lean hard into semantic tokens to help describe the experience in terms of purpose over value, we release control of the final presentation of the design to be informed by tokens way up the stack. We no longer prescribe that this card border thickness in this very specific spot must be <code>3px</code>. It should instead be applied by way of a mapping of a semantic token to a value in a theme curation exercise.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is not flexible to prescribe themable style via a classname. Using <code>.border-teal-darkest</code> has the same problem as having a token which is <code>--border-teal-darkest</code> applied directly to a component. <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/tokens-as-intents\">It's not semantic</a>. While you could dive deep into this by adding <em>more</em> classnames to address themes, it will become unwieldly. Additionally, I've also thoroughly described <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/ondark-virus\">the perils of calling something &quot;dark&quot;</a> which also has this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>It's hard to think in this abstract way, as folks who have been building UIs to specification have been forced into &quot;pixel-perfection&quot; for years. While we don't use the term much anymore, the effects remain. Designers will be disappointed if they expect to have exactly this color or precisely this thickness when working within their one context when multiple exist.</p>\n<h3>Reasoned classnames</h3>\n<p><strong>If it has a purpose, it should have a name.</strong> The screenshot example in the video during the quote shows a large red 'x' over some CSS with the following classnames: <code>.main-navbar</code>, <code>.main-navbar-list</code>, <code>.main-navbar-list-item</code>. From this list I can tell exactly what component will be affected by these styles. It should only exist in one part of the project.</p>\n<p>But what if it doesn't? That's the whole problem with naming. I could have another <code>.main-navbar</code> or worse <code>.btn</code> provided some some third-party library which then starts a style battle. I'm a lover, not a fighter!</p>\n<p>One answer is to have a standardized method of coming up with names; similar to the semantic token scheme perhaps including a namespace to distinguish between ownership. I believe a first approach could be to have the semantic token name and the classname to be near identical, differing only in the property that the token should be assigned being encoded into the token.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.ds-main-navbar</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--ds-main-navbar-background<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>In practice, I don't recommend being this specific but the concept is important. If you are too specific in token names, you'll wind up with thousands of tokens to describe every property of themable appearance. A better approach is to be slightly generic in the semantic token to cover several possible uses, but remain specific in the classname.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token comment\">/* These are specific styles for the main navigational bar component */</span><br /><span class=\"token selector\">.ds-main-navbar</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token comment\">/* token covers the background for all navigational surfaces */</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-color</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--ds-surface-navigation-background<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>The token can be applied to other similar surfaces but the classname identifies this specific component and the styles it needs. This can be similar to the <a href=\"https://en.bem.info/\">BEM (Block Element Modifier) structure</a> for classnames which identifies the parts of a component.</p>\n<p>This functions well for themable properties, but what about layout? Perhaps you don't want to continue to type out all 59 characters of <code>grid-template-colums: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr));</code> over and over again. I think that's a reasonable critism to have. In that case, it sound like you might have a new component on your hands.</p>\n<h2>Component driven development</h2>\n<p>In my opinion, the best approach is <em>to not have classes at all</em>. Instead I believe we should scope the styles to uniquely to the component. This can be accomplished in some CSS frameworks or using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM\">Shadow DOM</a>.</p>\n<p>Using the Shadow DOM technique, you can leverage <code>id</code> instead of <code>class</code> which further demonstrates that there should only be one of these elements within the component's scope.

While this sounds like a good thing for design because you can be be sure of the dimensions, the reality is that using pixel values in the web hinders user experience. Layouts become unresponsive, translated content becomes unreadable, and accessibility preferences just aren't considered. In most cases, we want to avoid absolute units and instead use something more flexible that adapts to the needs of the layout.</p>\n<p>Relative units are <em>related</em> to something else. An example of a relative unit is percentage and relates to different properties based on where it is used. The <code>rem</code> is a relative unit which roughly represents the size of the letter &quot;M&quot; in the document. If the document <code>font-size</code> changes, all areas where this unit is used will also change. The root <code>font-size</code> can change based on user preference; usually increasing to help folks with vision impairment. There is a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773\">not insignificant amount of the population</a> who leverage the ability to change the <code>font-size</code> in user settings so we want to ensure this feature of the web is maintained in our experiences. <a href=\"https://brokul.dev/detecting-the-default-browser-font-size-in-javascript\">It's possible to check this out for yourself.</a></p>\n<h2>Hocus pocus</h2>\n<p>There was <a href=\"https://clagnut.com/blog/348/\">a trick by Richard Rutter</a> discovered many years ago which was meant to help folks better understand relative font-size units when coming from pixels. The trick is to set the <code>font-size</code> of the document to <code>62.5%</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">html</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token property\">font-size</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 62.5%<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>It's important to know that when this trick was discovered, we didn't have <code>rem</code> units at all. The trick was attempting to solve for <code>em</code> units. These units are scoped to the parent <code>font-size</code> which can change at any time. So trying to get all of the sizes to behave is a nightmare. Luckily <code>rem</code> can only be changed in one place.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>The <code>62.5%</code> <em>looks like</em> what we like to call a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/\">magic number</a>; it seems oddly specific. The number is the ratio 10:16 as a percent. The default <code>rem</code> is 16 pixels, so 1/16th of a <code>rem</code> equals one pixel. Multiplying by 10 helps keep the font size <em>somewhat</em> readable (<code>6.25%</code> is too small, <code>625%</code> too large). Then the final use of this declaration allows for the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">button</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token property\">padding</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> .8rem 1.6rem<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* 8px 16px */</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Here, it is possible to write <code>rem</code> in terms of pixels. This provides <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/why-designers-should-move-from-px-to-rem-and-how-to-do-that-in-figma-c0ea23e07a15\">the benefits of <code>rem</code></a> while maintaining a pixel mental model. <a href=\"https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/62-5-percent-font-size-trick/\">This post by Aleksandr Hovhannisyan</a> goes into the approach in more detail also mentioning accessibility considerations. Some design systems (eg., <a href=\"https://workbench.gusto.com/getting-started/engineers/#css-resets\">Workbench by Gusto</a>) use the approach to make it &quot;easier&quot; to work with <code>rem</code> units. So what is so difficult that warrants this approach?</p>\n<p>The fact is that the <code>rem</code> doesn't exist in design tools, so a <strong>translation from pixels to <code>rem</code> must occur</strong> for an inclusive web experience. Before this approach, designers and engineers would need to figure out what the final <code>rem</code> number should be based on a formula. Then they would potentially need to repeat that formula every time a new size was needed. In other words, <a href=\"https://www.editorx.com/shaping-design/article/font-size\">math is hard and to repeat that math is a waste of time</a>. It is &quot;easier&quot; for the translation to occur once globally.</p>\n<p>So why would <a href=\"https://adactio.com/\">Jeremy Keith</a> say the following about the author and the approach nearly 20 years later?</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://twitter.com/adactio/status/1523743519034200067\">\n<p>Not that he—or anyone else—would recommend it these days!</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adactio/status/1523743519034200067\"><cite>Jeremy Keith</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h2>Absolutely arbitrary font-size</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/toheebdotcom\">Toheeb Ogunbiyi</a> does a deep dive into the <code>62.5%</code> approach and has some opinions about thinking in pixels:</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://www.toheeb.com/on/62.5-font-size-trick/\">\n<p>Thinking in pixels makes it easy to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Translate UI Design to code.</li>\n<li>Read the code in the editor.</li>\n<li>Troubleshoot the code in the browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This ensures a better development experience. In addition, the mental model is maintained across the team.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://www.toheeb.com/on/62.5-font-size-trick/\"><cite>Toheeb Ogunbiyi</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>What if I said that mental model being maintained is baseless artifact of legacy computer graphic design? 😱</p>\n<p>When you select a pixel font-size, what does it mean? More specifically, what is the difference between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)\">Courier</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana\">Verdana</a> at <code>16px</code>? In practice it's meant to represent <a href=\"https://typography.guru/term/em-square-r46\">the <code>em</code> square</a>. In the harsh reality, <a href=\"https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/4035/what-does-the-size-of-the-font-translate-to-exactly\">it doesn't really mean anything</a>. That means we could use 16 pigs, or 1 barn, maybe 8 tulips to talk about <code>font-size</code> if design tools were prepared to use these units. It actually doesn't matter as long as the visual result is expected. That's what we are really doing when curating <code>font-size</code>. We are tweaking some input and assessing the visual output. When we get something that Looks Good™, we record what the tool says in the input to repeat the visual style in digital media elsewhere.</p>\n<p>So why do we need to use the pixel value so much? It's because that's what design tools have decided to use to define the <code>font-size</code> among other computer graphic properties. If the design tool was to include the <code>rem</code> as an option, we would have a 1:1 relationship between the design expectation and the engineering execution and no need to require this translation at all! You could speak in terms of <code>rem</code> right in the tool; no math required. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1619640486305869824\">design tools are the problem</a> and this &quot;solution&quot; is a community hack for a missing feature.</p>\n<h2>Subverting expectations</h2>\n<p>When the <code>font-size</code> value is redefined at the <code>html</code> element, the representation of the <code>rem</code> is changed for the <em>entire document</em>. This means that third-party elements could look incorrect; designed with the <code>rem</code> to expect the browser <code>16px</code> default. This even includes usage of <code>rem</code> in the <a href=\"https://blog.openreplay.com/shadow-dom--the-ultimate-guide/\">Shadow DOM</a>. <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/joshwcomeau\">Josh W. Comeau</a> calls this out:</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#the-sixtwofive-trick-13\">\n<p>There's a baseline assumption on the web that <code>1rem</code> will produce readable text.

Comeau</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>He also mentions that adoption is difficult because it would need to be done all at once. There's no possibility of incremental enhancement. This also means that deprecating the approach is also troublesome. So you need to be very sure in this decision, more than most others.</p>\n<h2>Back to base</h2>\n<p>So instead of thinking in terms of pixels for font size, think in terms of a base (or root) size. What is the font size that is most used in the document? This is most likely your body copy. That should be what the <code>rem</code> represents and exist as the base. Next, any <code>font-size</code> that you want to set past this should be some proportion from the base. How much larger do you want the headline to be from the base? 1.5x larger? 2x larger? 2.5x larger? Guess what, that's <code>rem</code>! If you've set your headline to be 2.5x times larger than the base, that's <code>2.5rem</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">h1</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token property\">font-size</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 2.5rem<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* 2.5x times larger than your base (root) font-size */</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>If the user zooms the content, that relationship is maintained. This is what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andresgalante\">Andrés Galante</a> says in his article <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/\">&quot;Accessible Font Sizing, Explained&quot;</a> at CSS-Tricks:</p>\n<figure class=\"fig-quote\">\n  <blockquote cite=\"https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/#aa-think-about-proportions-not-size\">\n<p>Think about proportions, not size</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption data-density-shift=\"\">\n  — <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/accessible-font-sizing-explained/#aa-think-about-proportions-not-size\"><cite>Andrés Galante</cite></a>\n  </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p>While it's recommended to <em>not</em> update the <code>font-size</code> at <code>html</code> and maintain the default expectations, setting the size here <a href=\"https://taupecat.com/blog/2013/07/17/the-62-5-solution/\">isn't all bad</a> as long as it's made accessible. Just recognize that it does affect <em>all</em> use of <code>rem</code> throughout the page where this rule is applied. So reverting this approach later is an exercise of auditing all pages where <code>rem</code> is used and updating the values where appropriate. For large applications and systems, this could be a monumental task. However, if you've kept in mind that the <code>rem</code> is relating to the <code>font-size</code> in the usage, it might not be a difficult change. It might even be a feature of the approach. Though, if you use <code>rem</code> as just another unit because someone said it's better without understanding why, you might end up fighting <code>rem</code>.</p>\n<p>Don't dislike <code>rem</code> because you don't understand it, dislike pixels because you do.</p>",

Color, typography, and even <a href=\"https://complementary.space/\">spacing</a> can be described through semantic means. This drives the question, how do we name other properties semantically to further describe a generic experience?</p>\n<h2>Nested rounding</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-math-behind-nesting-rounded-corners/\">This article at Cloud Four</a> goes into the idea of nested rounding in detail. Essentially, we want the radius on rounded corners between nested elements to follow a shared focus (ie., center of a circle). The math is very simple, here it is using CSS notation:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.child</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token property\">border-radius</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">calc</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><br />        <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--ancestor-element-radius<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> - <br />        <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--distance-from-ancestor<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br />    <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Ultimately, we'd like to think of rounding in terms of semantics. However, because we want the rounding to be derived from elements, <em>we can avoid semantics entirely</em>. In practice, the reason we might use semantics is when we have decisions to make that are more complicated than just on/off. Semantics are used to describe the why we chose this value from a plethora of other possible values. In our rounding treatment, we shouldn't have more than one value. It should be a binary decision to include rounding or not and let other factors determine how round to achieve the nesting effect.</p>\n<p>In other words, when curating an experience, we'd like to <strong>simply mark elements which should receive nested rounding</strong>. Later, we provide some themable amount used by the rounding calculation which affects the rounding of marked elements in a uniform manner. We do not prescribe the rounding amount at any one element explicitly, we simply expect the appropriate nested rounding to exist when turned on.</p>\n<p>However, we have some problems to try and overcome.</p>\n<h2>Deriving values</h2>\n<p>The first problem is trying to get the <code>--ancestor-element-radius</code> and <code>--distance-from-ancestor</code> values for the formula. The ancestor part provides a clue to what makes this so difficult. <strong>The nested rounding calculation is dependent on the relationship between <em>two</em> elements.</strong> This is different from a <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/spacing-solved\">semantic spacing approach</a> as we only select a spacing token to convey a relationship. In the rounding formula, the final value is computed <em>using the resulting relationship</em> when the rounding is meant to be applied.</p>\n<p>When trying to fill the <code>--distance-from-ancestor</code> value, it's very likely that we will have several elements nested which may or may not include their own methods of supplying space. The properties of <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>gap</code>, and additional <code>position</code> and <code>transform</code> properties can all have a hand at visually presenting how far two elements are from each other, thereby making the <code>--distance-from-ancestor</code> value very challenging to determine.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>You could try computing this in JavaScript. You'd mark elements that you'd like to measure between and then write the value to a CSS Custom Property. There's a few pitfalls here; responsive changes, transforms, relative units, etc.. All of these things would make trying to capture this value a nightmare. This isn't a simple programmatic redlining exercise. On top of this, adding JavaScript to adjust a visual treatment seems like a bad use of the main thread. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">Web Workers</a> for <code>border-radius</code>? Now that's just crazy talk.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<p>Let's assume we have a system which can readily provide the <code>--distance-from-ancestor</code>. The <code>--ancestor-element-radius</code> in a perfect system would also be derived by the formula. So where does the base radius come from that influences all other nested rounding? Would it make sense for the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> to declare the first amount of rounding? Conceptually this seems incorrect since we don't expect the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> element to have rounding at all. Though, we can simply choose not to apply rounding at the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> and rather only define the value here.</p>\n<p>Another problem with starting from the top would be that some elements would never receive rounding. If you have a button which expects rounding to appear in two different places, it is possible that they receive different rounding amounts based on how many nested ancestors are marked for rounding between them. This could cause the same button to look different just by its placement within the layout.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/rounding-top-down.png\" alt=\"Content without rounding prescribes non-rounded button, content with rounding prescribes rounded button.\" /></p>\n<p>So, instead of starting at the top, could we start at the bottom? That is, could we declare what the smallest rounding is and then have marked ancestor elements use that value? After all, the center of the radius that determines the rounding must exist inside this element. Perhaps a new calculation would look like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.parent</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token property\">border-radius</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">calc</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><br />        <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--deepest-element-radius<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> + <br />        <span class=\"token function\">var</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>--distance-from-deepest<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br />    <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>In this way, the <code>--deepest-element-radius</code> can now be a fixed number, provided by a theme because there should be no smaller rounding applied. All rounding that occurs above this element is derived from this base amount. For the purposes of our exploration, let's call these deepest elements the <strong>rounding focus</strong>, as they possess the center which all ancestor element rounding radii would be computed in this system.</p>\n<p>The logic within marked ancestor elements would identify their deepest rounding focus and calculate the distance between their bounding boxes to determine the <code>--distance-from-ancestor</code>. We already know the difficulties in attempting this from above, but let's continue assuming we have a system in place which can prescribe the distance somehow.</p>\n<h2>Existential crisis</h2>\n<p>In explaining the logic to calculate the ancestor's rounding, I simplified the approach dramatically. In reality there's dozens of considerations that we'd need to account for. One of the largest problems returns back to rounding determined by an element's existence.</p>\n<p>Imagine we have a card layout and all cards are marked to include rounding but no cards include any elements which initiate rounding; our &quot;rounding focus&quot; elements. This would mean that none of the cards have rounded corners. When we add our rounded button to one of the cards, rounding would exist <em>only on that card</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/images/rounding-bottom-up.png\" alt=\"Button with rounding only influences one sibling, others are not rounded.\" /></p>\n<p>If you're thinking we could include a &quot;virtual&quot; rounding focus, a hidden element which triggers rounding, how do we allow the ancestors to measure the distance between edges? It's possible the cards' internal structures are completely different between them, making the rounding varied as well. What would be more desirable is for all sibling cards have the same rounding, whether they have a rounding focus or not. Except we've already determined that nested rounding is only determined between an element and ancestor, not from siblings. Do we then have further markings for rounded siblings to share values? Which sibling rounding takes priority?</p>\n<p>We're not done with problems. If we put the rounding focus element within the card, what distance should we measure? We <em>could</em> take the shortest distance and apply to all corners. However, what happens if we position that button in the center of the card; does the card become a circle because the button is positioned so far from the edges? Ok, perhaps we can set limits on the rounding using <code>max()</code>. But then if this hits the max, outer marked elements would get the same max radius thereby breaking the nesting effect.</p>\n<h2>Level headed</h2>\n<p>At this point you might ask why we haven't done what has been before; create levels of rounding. Since we don't need to be semantic, maybe this becomes a viable option?</p>\n<p>Let's say we start at the base level again with a rounded button, then we have a card component which gets the next level up. What happens when we include a rounded input with a rounded button inside? We would need to insert a rounding level in between. The loom of insertion is the biggest drawback using levels. How could we possibly account for all the layout nesting configurations which may be rounded to avoid levels being added or orphaned?</p>\n<p>At this point we're really more in search of a <em>layout</em> system than just a rounding system. Prescribing layouts <em>could</em> warrant the possibility of informing how round parts should be due to restrictions set by components of the system. We could know exactly what elements exist and the amount of space between them. Creating a robust layout system is outside the scope of this exploration since that would attempt to define all possible layouts for any hypothetical experience; a monumental task.</p>\n<p>So for the moment, I don't believe there's any possibility of a semantic nested rounding system due to the natural dependencies on existing elements. We're unfortunately stuck with a more meaningless system which can provide few nesting effects for curated components.</p>\n<p>But maybe that's the point. Other properties are decided in an experience based on qualities like feedback, hierarchy, and relationship:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The color orange often indicates a warning.</li>\n<li>Large text can support a section outline heading.</li>\n<li>Less space between items means they are related.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FonsMans/status/1620022363722240000\">If this isn't branding</a>, what information does corner rounding convey past being round? <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goose_egg\">Goose egg</a> 🥚.</p>",

      "value": "<p>The design hand-off process is often troublesome because of intentions lost in translation. We've created <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/terminal-career\">expertise in this space between design and engineering</a> to help smooth the exercise but we often try to find ways to bridge the gap without human intervention. One of these ways is generating resources to use from the design tool.</p>\n<p>I saw a great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbN9RGcQFNU\">Figma for developers video</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/megaroeny/status/1625680821372739586\">shared on social media</a> last month. This is definitely a part of the role that isn't often taught, leaving most engineers stumbling around the interface. There's a lot of helpful points made in the short presentation but I need to be critical about one area in particular; the inspect panel.</p>\n<h2>Proceed with caution</h2>\n<p>I consider the inspect panel to be a trap. Admittedly, calling it a trap is dramatic but it's also meant to warn folks who accept what the panel provides verbatim; possibly believing it's the blessed approach. I'll be referring to <a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055203533-Use-the-Inspect-panel\">Figma's inspect panel</a> in the following examples as the most popular tool to date but any design tool feature that claims to output code should be treated with skepticism.</p>\n<aside data-density-shift=\"\" role=\"note\" data-feedback=\"info\">\n  <div class=\"aside-content\">\n<p>This can exclude design tools that manipulate coded assets such as <a href=\"https://www.framer.com/\">Framer</a>. Because those assets are foundationally engineered, inspecting or exporting these is looking at the direct source code of the asset and not an estimated representation.</p>\n  </div>\n  </aside>\n<h3>Coordinate system</h3>\n<p>Figma, like many design tools, place assets on a coordinate system. Elements are added to the artboard and positioned relatively to the top-left corner. This isn't native to web layout, which works as a document where elements added are positioned relative to each other. DOM elements are situationally-aware of their ancestors and siblings to adjust their position. Could you change the positioning strategy for web elements? Yes, but you'll have a much harder time getting them to be accessible and responsive when you break out of the native document flow. Until design tools present the web using native alignment, developers will be left to intepret what a fixed coordinate system should do within document flow. The auto-layout concepts gets us to begin crossing this bridge but we're not entirely on the other side yet.</p>\n<p>💡 Shy from properties that update or declare the explicit position of an element such as <code>position</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>left</code>. Consider using modern CSS techniques like <code>display: flex;</code> to place the element in the preferred location. Work with the designer to learn about the intentions between different user and device preferences.</p>\n<h3>Hyper local font styles</h3>\n<p>Another feature of the web is that text styles cascade down to lower elements. You don't need to explicitly provide the text styles at every bit of copy. Especially if you <a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/blog/dont-use-too-many-web-fonts/\">limit the number of fonts to improve performance</a>. If you set the font styles for body copy on the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code> element, you don't need to reduplicate the font definition at the element which contains the copy. Unfortunately, Figma provides text styles for every individual bit of copy in the artboard. While you can be sure that this bit of text will get the styles when you copy from the inspect panel; you could optimize for less CSS by setting the appropriate style higher in the cascade. This is also great for when you need to update the font styles globally.</p>\n<p>💡 Set the font properties higher up (like at the <code>&lt;body/&gt;</code>) to allow the natural cascade to inform lower elements. Only update the property at the location where it doesn't match with the cascade.</p>\n<h3>Missing units</h3>\n<p>Figma and other design tools that claim they are for web design do not have web units. <a href=\"https://blog.damato.design/posts/62-5\">The <code>rem</code> unit is particularly important on the web</a>, but other units like percentage are also valuable when communicating layouts. Just watch out for <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/\">magic numbers</a>. The inspect panel is notorious for displaying verbose <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values in pixels. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nYyFf-97Qqg?t=118\">Expert CSS authors will tell you</a> that applying these as given in your code is bad practice. We'd rather allow the content to dictate the size of the container or base the dimensions off of some other relative proportion so every container is flexible to any content.</p>\n<p>💡 Ignore <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> properties when found and let the content determine how large the container should be. Consider <code>max-width</code> or <code>max-height</code> for large composition constraints. Work with the designer to determine what web units would work best in areas where they are needed. Avoid using pixels units for layout properties. Using pixels for decorative elements might be appropriate (ie. <code>border-width</code>).</p>\n<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing\"><code>box-sizing</code></a>: Hopefully this is already found higher in the cascade and <a href=\"https://andy-bell.co.uk/how-the-css-box-sizing-property-works/\">applied globally as <code>border-box</code></a>. This is what <a href=\"https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes\">it should have been by default</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/isolation\"><code>isolation</code></a>: This property creates a new <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Stacking_context\">stacking context</a> and you most likely won't need to apply this property when you see it in the panel. For more information on stacking contexts and when they are helpful, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/\">Josh W. Comeau's article</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order\"><code>order</code></a>: This property should be avoided. While it can change the order of elements as they are displayed visually, <a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/2015/09/source-order-matters.html\">the HTML won't match</a>. Change the layout order as HTML instead of this property.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow\"><code>overflow</code></a>: You should reserve this property to create a scrollable containers. Setting overflow past this reason will cause clipping in containers and other side-effects; such as creating a new <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context\">block-formatting context</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index\"><code>z-index</code></a>: You should try to avoid setting this property, especially in the case of considering a larger elevation system where collisions are unavoidable. For more information on why <code>z-index</code> should be considered an escape-hatch, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/\">Josh W. Comeau's article</a>. Yes, I've linked it twice in one post; it's that important.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stop, collaborate, and listen</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, your developer should be empowered to provide feedback on the design. Likewise, the developer shouldn't depend on what the expect panel presents as perfectly appropriate. There is an expertise in translation that must occur which only comes with practice and experience. Work together towards finding the best execution of the intended design. Dare I say, even <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/296790002\">include them in the process</a>. This can be the start of a beautiful partnership.</p>",

      "value": "<p>When I first heard of <a href=\"https://astro.build/\">Astro</a> it sounded incredible. I thought of it as the next step after working with <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">11ty</a>. That step is requiring framework support such as <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/#official-integrations\">React, Vue, or others</a>. While I often avoid frameworks, a framework allows for a shared understanding with a team to achieve a result within the guardrails, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CherryJimbo/status/1643778121944952833\">even if convoluted</a>.</p>\n<p>So for documentation sites that expect to host components written in a framework, Astro seems like a solid choice. However, my initial review of the project had some serious critism when finally attempting to build a site.</p>\n<h2>Low maintenance</h2>\n<p>One of the most important qualities of a documentation site is for it to be low maintenance. This can result in lots of different kinds of optimizations but one of the first I think about is how easy it is to create a new page and have it immediately appear in a navigational interface. It's a non-starter if I need to configure simple navigation by letting the project know that I made a new page and where that new page is in the project. We can do better, but at the time Astro just couldn't do this without accessing some internal methods and even then it didn't seem possible without rebuilding the entire site. The ergonomics weren't great and I decided to pause on the project.</p>\n<h2>Content collections</h2>\n<p>Astro has come a long way since my complaints. Earlier this year with the release of their v2.0, they have introduced <a href=\"https://astro.build/blog/introducing-content-collections/\">Content Collections</a>. Much of their post is talking about it being typesafe which is good but what I was more excited about was the ability to fetch content and manipulate it to render navigation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/\">The documentation suggests a few ways to configure a collection</a> but all of them assume you are manually curating the collection. I'd like to avoid this so you don't need to provide much instruction past &quot;put files here&quot;.</p>\n<p>Assume the following project <code>/src</code> file structure, reduced for brevity. We'll be discussing each top-level directory and its setup to get this to work.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">├── components<br />│   └── MainNavigation<br />│       └── index.jsx<br />├── content<br />│   ├── components<br />│   │   ├── button.mdx<br />│   │   └── <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.<br />│   ├── foundations<br />│   │   ├── color.mdx<br />│   │   └── <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.<br />│   ├── <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.<br />│   └── config.js<br />├── layouts<br />│   └── Page.astro<br />├── pages<br />│   ├── <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>collection<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><br />│   │   └── <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.slug<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>.astro<br />│   └── index.astro<br />├── utils<br />│   └── getAllCollections.js<br />└── <span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.</code></pre>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>The following is an example of how to <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-a-collection-schema\">define a collection from the Astro docs</a>. The most important part here is the <code>config.js</code> file shown below.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// 1. Import utilities from `astro:content`</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> z<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> defineCollection <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'astro:content'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token comment\">// 2.

The key needs to match your collection directory name. This means that when you add a new directory, this file needs to know and have definitions added. I want to avoid that, so here's my version:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> path <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'path'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> z<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> defineCollection <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'astro:content'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> glob <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>meta<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">glob</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'./**'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* vite */</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> collectionNames <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> Object<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">keys</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>glob<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">filepath</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> path<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">basename</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>path<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">dirname</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>filepath<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> schema <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token literal-property property\">schema</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> z<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">object</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">title</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> z<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">string</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">assignCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">acc<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> Object<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">assign</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>acc<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">defineCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>schema <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> collections <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> collectionNames<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">reduce</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>assignCollection<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>The first new part is using <a href=\"https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import\">the <code>glob</code> function from Vite</a> to get all files relative to this config file. We could be more specific here to look only for <code>.md{x,} </code> but this works fine as-is.</p>\n<p>After using the <code>glob</code> function to get the files, we parse the filepaths to get the directory that each one is in. This assumes that each section (eg., <code>/blog</code>) is only one level deep. This will return an array of directory names that we'll use later. For us, this return <code>['components', 'foundations']</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <code>collectionNames</code> array is reduced using the <code>assignCollection</code> function. This creates a new collection definition with each section in the same way we would have done it manually in the original example. During the build step, Astro will create types based on the schema.</p>\n<p>Before moving on, make sure you have some content in the markdown files (including the <code>title</code> frontmatter) to test out.</p>\n<h3>Pages</h3>\n<p>Next we'll dynamically render our pages. We've set up a <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes\">dynamic route</a> at <code>[collection][...slug].astro</code>. As you might have guessed, the <code>collection</code> part is the directory name found within <code>/content</code> from earlier. For our file structure, this'll eventually write <code>components</code> and <code>foundations</code> into the url. The slug is created from the file names in each of these directories (<code>button</code> and <code>color</code>). Here's how we get that to work using frontmatter in the <code>[...slug].astro</code> file which is mostly copied from <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#building-for-static-output-default\">the official documentation</a>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Page <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@layouts/Page.astro'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> getAllCollections <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@utils/getAllCollections.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">getStaticPaths</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> content <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"token function\">getAllCollections</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> content<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">entry</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">params</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">slug</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> entry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>slug<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">collection</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> entry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>collection <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br />    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">props</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> entry <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> entry <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> Astro<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>props<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> Content <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> entry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>A few things to note. The <code>@layouts</code> alias points to the <code>/layouts</code> directory where I have a single <code>Page.astro</code> as the base layout. The <code>@utils</code> alias points to reusable functions. <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/aliases/\">These aliases can be setup</a> in the <code>tsconfig.json</code> file at the root of the project. The <code>getAllCollections</code> function we will need to use twice. Once here to make the paths to content, and a second time to build navigation. I imagine there's a way for this to run once, but this was easiest for me while I explored this solution.</p>\n<p>This is what the <code>getAllCollections</code> function looks like:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> getCollection <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'astro:content'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> collectionNames <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'@content/config'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">getAllCollections</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> collections <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> Promise<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">all</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><br />    collectionNames<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token function\">getCollection</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> collections<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">flat</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>The <code>getCollection</code> function from Astro will get the data for a single given collection. We have created a list of collections back at the <code>content/config.js</code> file as an export called <code>collectionNames</code>. So we loop over that to get all of the content and write the section it came from within the metadata. After resolving all the promises, we flatten the result because this is a single-level navigational structure. If you need nesting, you might not want to flatten the results here and have your own tree returned.</p>\n<p>At this point we should be rendering pages dynamically.

One common challenge is providing reasonable defaults that work for most use cases, while still allowing customization when necessary.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine an alert message component that can display different status states, such as success, warning, and danger.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2023-02-28-reusable-component-patterns-defult-slots/alert-components.png\" alt=\"A set of alert components with a default status icon for each\" style=\"max-width: 600px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"781\" height=\"377\" />\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>default alert<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">status</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>info<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>info alert<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">status</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>success<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>success alert<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">status</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>warning<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>warning alert<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">status</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>danger<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>danger alert<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Each state may require a different icon to be displayed within the alert message. By default, the component can provide its own set of icons for each status state, but this may not be sufficient for all use cases.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2023-02-28-reusable-component-patterns-defult-slots/alert-component-with-custom-icon.png\" alt=\"A alert component with a custom icon\" style=\"max-width: 600px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"776\" height=\"72\" />\n<p>One approach to address this challenge is to use the Shadow DOM feature <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots\">Slots</a>, which allow developers to customize or project content into specific parts of a component's template without having to modify the component's implementation.</p>\n<p>With default slots, the alert component can internally provide default icons for different status states, while still allowing developers to customize the icons as needed. Here's an example of how this could be implemented:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- ui-alert template --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>icon<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-icon</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span>${this.status}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-icon</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The above code defines a default slot named &quot;icon&quot; within the alert component's template. It uses JavaScript template literals to dynamically set the name of the icon based on the status of the alert.</p>\n<p>Developers can then use this slot to project their own icon into the alert component, overriding the default icon:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- API usage --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>span</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">slot</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>icon<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>🎉<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  custom icon alert<br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>In the above example, the developer is passing a custom icon to the alert component using the <code>icon</code> slot. The component will render this custom icon instead of the default icon for the &quot;warning&quot; status state.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2023-02-28-reusable-component-patterns-defult-slots/alert-components-with-custom-icon.png\" alt=\"A set of alert components with a flexible customization API using slots\" style=\"max-width: 600px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"778\" height=\"445\" />\n<p>By using default slots, we can mitigate the risk of tightly coupled APIs and maintain a clear separation of concerns between the alert and icon elements. It also allows developers to have full control over the custom icon without the alert element needing to expose the icon through a series of inherited attributes and properties.</p>\n<p>As with all API design choices, there are tradeoffs involved and it's important to consider the benefits and potential challenges of each approach. However, using default slots is a powerful technique for building reusable components that provide reasonable defaults while also allowing for customization when necessary.

      "value": "<p>In this post we will take a look at one of the common pitfalls when designing a highly reusable UI component. We will look at the various tradeoffs when rendering application provided content within our reusable component.</p>\n<p>When designing composition-based component APIs, it is important to push the semantics of the HTML into the light DOM or within control of the consumer. This helps to create valid DOM structure and improved overall accessibility. For example, if a card component includes an <code>h1</code> heading, this creates an incorrect DOM structure as there should only be one <code>h1</code> element within the page. By pushing the semantics of the heading up into the light DOM, the consumer can control the heading level and ensure that the page structure is correct.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- ui-card internal template --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>header<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>footer<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- consumer API --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-card</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">slot</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>header<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>header<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>content<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-card</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>It is important to push the semantic meaning of elements up to the consumer, rather than obfuscating it internally. This enables the consumer to control the appropriate heading levels for their page, which is important for accessibility and features like <code>aria-describedby</code> for associating content. By exposing the semantic meaning of elements to the consumer, we can enable more accessible and flexible behaviors in our components and libraries.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- ui-card internal template --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>header<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>slot</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>footer<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>slot</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- consumer API --></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-card</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h2</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">slot</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>header<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>header<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br />  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>content<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><br /><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-card</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p>This example uses Web Components and Shadow DOM however this principal applies to frameworks as well, like React children props and Angular ng-content.</p>\n<p>Composition-based APIs may sometimes be more verbose than other approaches, however they have the advantage of lowering the overall API surface area of the system and ensuring that there is only one way to use any component. This makes it easier for consumers to learn and use the APIs, as the usage remains predictable and reliable throughout the system.</p>\n<p>API abstractions can provide a convenient layer on top of the components, making them more concise and opinionated while still enabling consumers to access the reusable components directly as needed. However, it is important to carefully consider the tradeoffs involved in using these abstractions. It's easier to add new abstractions but much more difficult to fix or remove the wrong abstractions.</p>",

      "value": "<p>Web Components provide a native component model for UI components. In addition, web Components encapsulate several stand-alone APIs such as Custom Elements, Shadow DOM for CSS encapsulation, slots for content projection, and Element Internals for accessibility and form participation. In this post, we will see how a basic text input Web Component can be used inside an Angular form using the Reactive Forms API.</p>\n<p>By default, when creating a Web Component with Shadow DOM, the HTML, CSS, and ID attributes are all encapsulated to that element's shadow root. The shadow root ensures styles and id attributes are no longer global, making maintenance much easier but also means native inputs are not accessible to any code outside of the element.</p>\n<p>Using the Element Internals API, we can enable our Web Components to participate or enable native form control support. This API allows us to have encapsulated styles and behaviors while enabling consumers of our components to use them just like any other form control.</p>\n<h2 id=\"form-associated-custom-elements\">Form Associated Custom Elements <a class=\"post-anchor\" href=\"https://coryrylan.com/blog/using-web-components-in-angular-forms-with-element-internals.html#form-associated-custom-elements\" aria-label=\"heading permalink\"><svg width=\"36\" height=\"30\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M17.6 24.32l-2.46 2.44a4 4 0 01-5.62 0 3.92 3.92 0 010-5.55l4.69-4.65a4 4 0 015.62 0 3.86 3.86 0 011 1.71 2 2 0 00.27-.27l1.29-1.28a5.89 5.89 0 00-1.15-1.62 6 6 0 00-8.44 0l-4.7 4.69a5.91 5.91 0 000 8.39 6 6 0 008.44 0l3.65-3.62h-.5a8 8 0 01-2.09-.24z\"></path><path d=\"M28.61 7.82a6 6 0 00-8.44 0l-3.65 3.62h.49a8 8 0 012.1.28l2.46-2.44a4 4 0 015.62 0 3.92 3.92 0 010 5.55l-4.69 4.65a4 4 0 01-5.62 0 3.86 3.86 0 01-1-1.71 2 2 0 00-.28.23l-1.29 1.28a5.89 5.89 0 001.15 1.62 6 6 0 008.44 0l4.69-4.65a5.92 5.92 0 000-8.39z\"></path><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h36v36H0z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Using the new Element Internals API, we can register our custom elements to a form element so our component can interact with the form providing form data and validation.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">MyControl</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">extends</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">HTMLElement</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  #internals <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">attachInternals</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br />  <span class=\"token keyword\">static</span> formAssociated <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><br />  <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />    <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">attachShadow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> mode<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'open'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> delegatesFocus<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>shadowRoot<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>innerHTML <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\"><br />      &lt;style><br />        input {<br />          box-sizing: border-box;<br />          padding: 4px 12px;<br />          border: 2px solid #2d2d2d;<br />          border-radius: 24px;<br />          width: 100%;<br />        }<br />      &lt;/style><br />      &lt;input type=\"text\" /></span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br />customElements<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">define</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'my-control'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> MyControl<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>Our component has two particular lines that enable form participation. First is the <code>#internals = this.attachInternals()</code>. The <code>attachInternals</code> call enables a suite of APIs for our component to access, allowing it to use features native HTML Elements use. This include behaviors for <a href=\"https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html\">accessibility</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals/states\">CSS custom states</a> and forms.</p>\n<p>Next is the static call <code>static formAssociated = true</code>. This line enables a set of APIs for our component to access and use for forms. Our template encapsulates some styles and a native input. This input, however, is not accessible, but with the Element Internals, the <code>my-control</code> element now has the basics needed for implementing form controls, just like the native input.</p>\n<p>To enable the basic value and validation logic, we need to add additional setters/getters to consumers of <code>my-control</code> can treat it just like any other input type.</p>\n<pre

<code>ngDefaultControl</code> directive. This directive tells the Angular form API to treat this element tag as a standard string text input. With this, the Angular forms API will fully work with your custom element. You can attach this directive automatically by creating a global directive that uses the <code>my-control</code> tag name.</p>\n<p>Also, note the <code>ngDefaultControl</code> only works with <code>string</code> value types. Form inputs, including Web Components, can have other types such as <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code> and <code>date</code>. If you are interested in Angular adding support for this, I recommend opening an issue or commenting/upvoting this PR <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/45953\">Add explicit selectors for all built-in ControlValueAccessors</a>.</p>\n<p>Another possible workaround is providing directives that extend the internal Control Value Accessors to enable Angular Forms to be compatible with other control types.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span

      "value": "<p>Theming in CSS has improved quite a bit in the past few years. CSS Custom Properties introduced true dynamic theming to the Web. New features recently have shipped or are being proposed that can take theming even further.</p>\n<p>Features such as <code>color-scheme</code> allow us or the user to define preferences such as dark themes or high contrast modes in the browser. This immediately improves the default native controls when switching to <code>color-scheme: dark</code>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/chrome-color-scheme-light.png\" alt=\"chrome color scheme light\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"462\" height=\"256\" />\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/chrome-color-scheme-dark.png\" alt=\"chrome color scheme dark\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"457\" height=\"251\" />\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color\">accent-color</a> property makes color customizations across native controls easy and with only one line of CSS. The benefit of <code>accent-color</code> is the browser can automatically generate the various color states and contrasts based on the single color provided. This ensures a consistent and accessible experience for users and reduces a lot of custom CSS from having to be created.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/chrome-accent-color-light.png\" alt=\"chrome accent color light\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"454\" height=\"313\" />\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/chrome-accent-color-dark.png\" alt=\"chrome accent color dark\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"453\" height=\"312\" />\n<p>Now while <code>accent-color</code> and <code>color-scheme</code> helps customize native controls easier, it doesn't help us with custom components or elements we want to customize, like buttons.</p>\n<p>Typically, when styling interaction states on buttons, we adjust the element's background color based on the state.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">button</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> gray<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token selector\">button:hover</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> lightgray<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><br /><br /><span class=\"token selector\">button:hover</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> darkgray<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Reassigning the background colors, however, introduces a lot of maintenance. In addition, for each color of an interactive element, we have several potential interaction states, <code>default</code>, <code>hover</code>, <code>active</code>, <code>selected</code>, and <code>disabled</code>. Then if we add theming, this further complicates the number of color values we have to define.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secondary-background-color-with-css-background-image\">Secondary Background Color with CSS Background Image <a class=\"post-anchor\" href=\"https://coryrylan.com/blog/css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast.html#secondary-background-color-with-css-background-image\" aria-label=\"heading permalink\"><svg width=\"36\" height=\"30\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M17.6 24.32l-2.46 2.44a4 4 0 01-5.62 0 3.92 3.92 0 010-5.55l4.69-4.65a4 4 0 015.62 0 3.86 3.86 0 011 1.71 2 2 0 00.27-.27l1.29-1.28a5.89 5.89 0 00-1.15-1.62 6 6 0 00-8.44 0l-4.7 4.69a5.91 5.91 0 000 8.39 6 6 0 008.44 0l3.65-3.62h-.5a8 8 0 01-2.09-.24z\"></path><path d=\"M28.61 7.82a6 6 0 00-8.44 0l-3.65 3.62h.49a8 8 0 012.1.28l2.46-2.44a4 4 0 015.62 0 3.92 3.92 0 010 5.55l-4.69 4.65a4 4 0 01-5.62 0 3.86 3.86 0 01-1-1.71 2 2 0 00-.28.23l-1.29 1.28a5.89 5.89 0 001.15 1.62 6 6 0 008.44 0l4.69-4.65a5.92 5.92 0 000-8.39z\"></path><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h36v36H0z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>Leveraging the CSS <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image\">background-image</a> property, we can create a &quot;secondary&quot; background color that we can adjust based on the current state.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">button</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> blue<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />  <span class=\"token property\">background-image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">linear-gradient</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">hsla</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0%<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0%<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0.5<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> 0 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br /><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Using HSLA, we can adjust the alpha value of either black to darken or white to lighten the background color.

This feature gives us the native functionality that browsers internally have today.</p>\n<p>With Safari Technical Preview, you can enable CSS <code>color-contrast</code> behind the experimental flag.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/safari-color-contrast-light.png\" alt=\"safari color contrast light\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"384\" height=\"302\" />\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/safari-color-contrast-dark.png\" alt=\"safari color contrast dark\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"378\" height=\"298\" />\n<p>Now with any accent color, we choose the text color that will automatically adjust to the best contrast level.</p>\n<p><video src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/video/posts/2022-10-30-css-interaction-theming-with-accent-color-and-color-contrast/safari-css-color-contrast.mp4\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" controls=\"\" style=\"max-width: 500px\" class=\"post-video\"></video></p>\n<p>With <code>accent-color</code> and hopefully the adoption of <code>color-contrast</code> automatic and configurable interactions, styles are making themeing in CSS easier than ever. Hopefully, future API proposals will enable us to leverage the internals of the <code>accent-color</code> feature for custom elements without the need for workarounds like <code>background-image</code>.

This series will leverage Web Components for the implementation demos, but the concepts and approaches to API design apply to all UI component frameworks.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will dive into API design for UI components when passing data or setting the state of a UI component. First, let's look at an alert component for our example.</p>\n<img src=\"https://coryrylan.com/assets/images/posts/2022-09-30-reusable-ui-components-and-data-binding/simple-alert-component-states.png\" alt=\"Simple Alert Component for UI API design\" style=\"max-width: 400px\" class=\"post-img\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"868\" height=\"702\" />\n<p>Our alert component has a few different options available. For example, this alert component could have any number of visual states and the option to make the alert box closable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"properties-vs.-attributes\">Properties vs. Attributes <a class=\"post-anchor\" href=\"https://coryrylan.com/blog/reusable-ui-components-and-data-binding.html#properties-vs.-attributes\" aria-label=\"heading permalink\"><svg width=\"36\" height=\"30\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M17.6 24.32l-2.46 2.44a4 4 0 01-5.62 0 3.92 3.92 0 010-5.55l4.69-4.65a4 4 0 015.62 0 3.86 3.86 0 011 1.71 2 2 0 00.27-.27l1.29-1.28a5.89 5.89 0 00-1.15-1.62 6 6 0 00-8.44 0l-4.7 4.69a5.91 5.91 0 000 8.39 6 6 0 008.44 0l3.65-3.62h-.5a8 8 0 01-2.09-.24z\"></path><path d=\"M28.61 7.82a6 6 0 00-8.44 0l-3.65 3.62h.49a8 8 0 012.1.28l2.46-2.44a4 4 0 015.62 0 3.92 3.92 0 010 5.55l-4.69 4.65a4 4 0 01-5.62 0 3.86 3.86 0 01-1-1.71 2 2 0 00-.28.23l-1.29 1.28a5.89 5.89 0 001.15 1.62 6 6 0 008.44 0l4.69-4.65a5.92 5.92 0 000-8.39z\"></path><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h36v36H0z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>For many web UI frameworks and Web Components, data is passed via HTML attributes or JavaScript properties for generic/reusable components. Depending on the UI environment/tools used, this subtle difference can be abstracted. However, understanding the differences and how they may impact your API decisions is essential.</p>\n<p>For Web Components, it's ideal for supporting both HTML attributes and JavaScript properties to set data on your components. Many Web Component authoring tools like <a href=\"https://lit.dev/\">lit</a> provide an easy way to keep both the properties and attributes in sync for maximum flexibility and support to your component consumers.</p>\n<p>Attributes are set in the HTML directly. Attributes are always string values as its parsed out of the DOM. However, other data types, like numbers, can be passed in as long as your component converts the provided type.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>ui-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">status</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>success<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>success<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>ui-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> alert <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">querySelector</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'ui-alert'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br />alert<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>status <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'warning'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>Properties are set on the DOM object in JavaScript. Many UI frameworks default to setting properties rather than attributes, and most provide a template syntax to explicitly chose how you want to set the component value.</p>\n<pre

Web Components typically leverage the Shadow DOM providing CSS encapsulation to ensure styles only apply to the component's template.</p>\n<p>When using Shadow DOM, the styles are fully encapsulated, preventing accidental styling globally or within the template. Using CSS Custom Properties, we can create public APIs for how we enable or allow our reusable components to be customized.

      "value": "\n      <p>WCAG 2.2 is a somewhat delayed update to 2.1 and adds 9 new success criteria on top of the existing ones in 2.1. It is primarily concerned with visual, cognitive and motor skill impairments.</p>\n<h2>When will WCAG 2.2 be released?</h2>\n<p>Changes to the new criteria following feedback after the draft stages has been taken into account and a new candidate recommendation has been released (Jan 2023). This is now being looked at by the accessibility community for the ability to test, ease of understanding and impact for users. It is likely that the final recommendation will be released in the second quarter of 2023.</p>\n<h2>When will WCAG 2.2 become a legal requirement?</h2>\n<p>WCAG itself is not a law but a series of guidelines. However it is referenced by other laws and is likely to be made reference to in legal cases.</p>\n<p>WCAG is currently referenced in the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (and the European equivalent) as the minimum standard to be reached. That 2018 regulation has already been amended (in 2022) to prepare for the new release of the guidelines. The new statement now reads (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A website or mobile application of a public sector body will be presumed to be in conformity with the accessibility requirement to the extent that the website or mobile application conforms to Level A and AA Success Criteria as set out in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium, as amended from time to time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such as soon as the new criteria are published they become enforceable.</p>\n<h2>Are UK sites expected to be conformant as soon as they are released?</h2>\n<p>Once the final recommendations are published there is likely to be a 12 month grace period for UK public sector sites to ensure they are compliant. The GOVUK Design System team will need to update their components and release them - they have a goal to do this within 6 months of release. This will give public sector teams an additional 6 months to apply those changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2022/12/09/some-changes-to-the-public-sector-digital-accessibility-regulations/\">UK government sites will being to be monitored for compliance in 2024.</a></p>\n<p>However it would be beneficial for site owners to begin to review their designs now to see where the new criteria might affect them and begin to plan accordingly.</p>\n<h2>What should I do?</h2>\n<p>Most of these changes are likely to affect more commercial sites so if you are working on non-governmental clients there is likely to be more work required. However even if you only use government department components there is still work you can do to prepare.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t rush to make changes. Wait for the final release of the guidelines. But this doesn’t mean you cannot plan.</li>\n<li>If you are responsible for procuring sites or services you should look to have WCAG 2.2 named in the contractual agreement as a requirement so everyone understands what is expected of them.</li>\n<li>If you have a Design System, make sure the design system team are aware of the upcoming changes and have a plan ready.</li>\n<li>Ensure that your own team is using the latest version of the relevant code libraries and that components used are being updated alongside libraries so you can take advantage of the central code updates when they come through.</li>\n<li>Review any components your team have built and check that none of the new criteria affect them. Create a plan to update them if so.</li>\n<li>Some of these changes are purely visual (like Focus Appearance) but others might require reworking of components (Dragging Movements) or even whole journeys (Accessible Authentication and Redundant Entry). Get the whole team involved so everyone knows what the aims of the criteria are and how you will meet them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Has anything changed in the existing criteria?</h2>\n<p>Two things have changed - <em>Parsing</em> has been removed (the first time this has happened) and the status of <em>Focus Visible</em> has been upgraded to level A instead of level AA.</p>\n<h3>4.1.1 Parsing (A) has been removed</h3>\n<p>There has been a lot of debate around this, but at the moment it looks like it will be removed because any failures caught by it currently are also covered by other criteria. This criteria often causes confusion around what is or is not classed as a failure vs just bad code. Much improved parity between browsers in how they handle poor html means its impact can be anticipated now whereas before it was often a different outcome for different browsers.</p>\n<p>For example a duplicate ID might be an issue only if it is being to reference an element for accessibility purposes. Removal of this criteria means the confusion is removed and we can concentrate on the actual impact on the user.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep checking your HTML validates - it is still one of the simplest ways to check for a bunch of knock-on effects from accessibility to rendering and styling.</p>\n<p>As WCAG is mean to be backwards-compatible and this is the first time a criterion has been removed, it’s not sure what effect, if any, this will have on things like the ISO (which is still using WCAG 2.0 as a benchmark).</p>\n<h3>2.4.7 Focus Visible (A) has been updated</h3>\n<p>This criterion was rated AA under WCAG 2.1 but has been moved to A under 2.2</p>\n<h2>What are the new criteria?</h2>\n<h3>2.4.11 Focus Appearance (AA)</h3>\n<p>This is the most wide-ranging change as it is likely to impact most websites and even challenges some of the more basic styling techniques used for focus indication.</p>\n<p>There is already a criterion called Focus Visible, but the requirements for it are quite minimal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There wasn’t any minimum requirements of what that indicator should look like - is a thin border ok? visible to who - someone with good eyesight?</p>\n<p>This new criterion looks to pin that indicator down with a series of rules around what the indicator should looks like. It boils down to these rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>good contrast (3:1) against other states and adjacent colours</li>\n<li>a size equivalent to a 1px border around the element, or a 4px border on the shortest side of the element</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are however details of this criterion which are <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/2679\">causing confusion in the community</a> around how these values are calculated for specific use-cases. Also, how would this impact the standard application of a text-underline on focus? That underline is generally set to just 1px which is below the threshold for passing this criterion and places a lot of sites at risk of failing this straight away.</p>\n<p>So at the moment this criterion is marked “At risk” but is unlikely to be changed at this stage so will either be implemented as it is or get pulled before publication. If it gets implemented expect a bit of confusion around how this should be tested and if something passes it or not.</p>\n<p>Even if this criterion does not make it into the final release, it is worthwhile revisiting your product’s focus indicators to see if they really are as visible as they could be.</p>\n<p>Alistair Campbell, part of the WCAG editorial team, has <a href=\"https://alastairc.uk/2023/02/focus-appearance-thoughts/\">a good breakdown of the latest version</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"note note--update\">\n<p><strong>Update: 22 March 2023</strong>  <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2023JanMar/0309.html\">this looks to have been dropped from AA level to AAA level</a>. This is a disappointing move as it leaves us without a clear definition of what visible actually means at the commonly used compliance levels of A and AA, despite Focus Visible still being a AA criterion.</p>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html\">Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.11: Focus Appearance</a></p>\n<h3>2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA)</h3>\n<p>Still looking at improving how focus is handled in WCAG, this criterion ensures that after you have created a visible indicator, that you don’t then have something obscuring it entirely such as a non-modal dialog, a sticky navigation or cookie banner when it is focussed.</p>\n<p>Think of when you tab down a page and the navigation stays fixed to the top of the browser window - we want to ensure the item with focus on the page is not covered by that navigation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum\">Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.12: Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a></p>\n<h3>2.4.13 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) (AAA)</h3>\n<p>This is the partner to the above criterion. Being the AAA version this is more strict and requires that no part of the focus indicator is obscured.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-enhanced\">Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.13: Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a></p>\n<h3>2.5.7 Dragging Movements (AA)</h3>\n<p>This criterion is designed to help users who have difficulty with precision actions or who have to use non-standard input methods (such as eye-tracking). If an interface component requires a user to use a dragging motion to complete an action, then there must be a way of completing the action without dragging using a single pointer (ie not multi-touch gestures).</p>\n<p>An example might be dragging a 3D visualisation of something to see it from all angles. Having arrow buttons would allow a user to be able to accomplish the same.</p>\n<p>Another example is being able to drag items in a list to sort them, but also being able to click on an item in the list and have arrows appear to allow the item to be moved up and down.</p>\n<p>A partner to this criterion is the existing 2.1.1 Keyboard but it was found there are instances where keyboard equivalence does not always equate to single pointer equivalence so a separate criterion was needed.</p>\n<p>For example think of a horizontally scrolling component. It can be swiped (multi-touch) and keyboard can access it (because of focusable items inside it), but users who use a head-pointer will not be able to scroll it. This criteria catches these cases which would otherwise fall outside WCAG.</p>\n<p>This new criterion also helps cover off touch experiences more comprehensively - but remember people on mobiles might want to use an external keyboard and those on desktops might zoom in and trigger a mobile view. It’s often best to consider viewport and input modalities as unrelated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements\">Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.7: Dragging Movements</a></p>\n<h3>2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA)</h3>\n<p>Target size has been part of design best practice for a long time and is covered currently by WCAG 2.5.5 (AAA) which requires a target of at least 44px by 44px (which is what Apple and Google recommend for their mobile interfaces). This new criterion adds a new minimum requirement at the AA level of 24px by 24px. Because of the AA rating this now comes under many of the legal requirements of various countries.</p>\n<p>The same exemptions apply to this criterion as apply to the AAA one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the target is inline text within other copy (such as a paragraph) - note stacked links in a list are not exempted</li>\n<li>the target size is essential for communicating information (for example map pins might need to be clustered to convey location)</li>\n<li>browser defaults - like some other criteria, if you don’t alter a browser’s interpretation of a control (such as a calendar widget) then this does not apply</li>\n<li>duplication - if another control which is compliant performs the same action as the non-complaint one means the non-compliant one is exempted as the user has the option to use the other control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there is an additional one for this new criterion around spacing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>spacing - a target can be under 24px as long as the space between it and the next target makes up the difference. So a 20px button can be next to another one as long as there is a 4px gap between them. This might seem odd as it makes it possible to make a tiny target, but this criterion is all about accuracy rather than perception - can the user action this target without hitting others by mistake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teams should still look to meet the AAA standard where possible (especially where the platform states it in their documentation as Apple and Google do), but this criterion does at least make everyone look to ensure they are doing the minimum.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html\">Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.8: Target Size (Minimum)</a></p>\n<h3>3.2.6 Consistent Help (A)</h3>\n<p>In order to make interfaces more consistent and help users find help when they need it (often a stressful situation), where a site displays certain help features, these should be present in the same place in relation to other content, on each page.</p>\n<p>The features this applies to are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>human contact details - this can be important for certain users who may find it difficult to use other methods of assistance\n<ul>\n<li>human contact details - email, phone number, opening hours</li>\n<li>human contact mechanism - non-automated chat, contact form, social media</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>self-help options - FAQs, support pages</li>\n<li>fully-automated contact mechanism - chatbot</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chat interfaces are especially useful as they allow the user to retain the current context whilst interacting with the source of help and allow the user to use their own vocabulary rather than the site’s.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean the site has to provide these options - just if they are that they are presented consistently.</p>\n<p>As the user moves through the site those contact features should be in the same relative visual location so the user knows where to look. If the user changes the screen size then all pages should act in the same way in where the contact options end up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help\">Understanding Success Criterion 3.2.6: Consistent Help</a></p>\n<h3>3.3.7 Accessible Authentication (AA)</h3>\n<p>This criterion is designed to help users log into sites as smoothly as possible. Having to solve a puzzle, transcribe information (unless you can copy &amp; paste) or remember usernames and passwords can be a real struggle for many users - these are classed as a cognitive function test.</p>\n<p>Username and password fields which are marked up correctly (and don’t prevent copy &amp; paste) can allow the browser or password managers to fill in the fields on behalf of the user which would then pass this criterion. Note personal information such as name, email address or phone number are not classed as a cognitive function test (though not allowing those to be auto-filled would fail WCAG 1.3.5 Identify Purpose).</p>\n<p>Old-style bank authentication of the style “enter the 4th 6th and 8th characters from your password” would also fail this criteria as it requires transcription and does not support copy &amp; paste or autocomplete.</p>\n<p>reCaptcha are exempted because the objects displayed are classed as “familiar” objects (think traffic lights), despite there being obvious issues with many of the source images and names being pulled from the US. Note those old-style Captchas which had a deformed word you had to recognise would fail this because it is not a familiar object and requires transcribing.</p>\n<p>This criteria also applies to 2-factor authentication (it’s no good having an accessible first step if you then have to solve a puzzle on your phone) and username and password recovery (an essential part of authentication).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication\">Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.8: Accessible Authentication</a></p>\n<h3>3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (No Exception) (AAA)</h3>\n<p>This is a stricter version of the above. It removes the object exemption (and so the option for reCaptcha).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-no-exception\">Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.8: Accessible Authentication (No Exception)</a></p>\n<h3>3.3.9 Redundant Entry (A)</h3>\n<p>On the face of it this is a simple criterion - don’t ask the user the same questions you already have the answers for, or at least tell them what they entered before so they can select it as an option. For example <em>“you said your email address was x would you like to use that?“</em> rather than <em>“enter your email address“</em> again.</p>\n<p>What we are trying to avoid is the user having to enter the same data they already have and either getting a mismatch or having to use additional effort to enter or recall the data they previously entered.</p>\n<p>Note - browser autocomplete is not a sufficient mechanism to pass this criterion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the <em>same process</em> is either auto-populated, or available for the user to select</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However the definition of a process says also can run across different domains. This paragraph from the guidelines could have an impact:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>so if a check-out process includes a 3rd party payment provider, that would be in scope</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if the payment provider were to ask for an address which the user had already entered as part of their checkout process, this must be passed through to the provider page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry\">Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.7: Redundant Entry</a></p>\n\n    ",

I'd go as far as saying just never use them.)</p>\n<p>So if you take the link from our first example and add an <code>aria-label</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Tom<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Bob<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>that will overwrite the contents and the accessible name is now “Tom”.

However because the SVG had a title attribute, this is what is exposed as an accessible name (as it counts as Contents as far as accessibility is concerned). The title whilst meaningful to the designer who exported it, is not of any use to the end-user, not least because it suggests the arrow points in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>For those wondering, yes the left button uses the same SVG and the image rotated for the opposite direction, so both left and right buttons on the carousel had “chevronLeft” as their accessible name.</p>\n<p>What they should have done in this case was hide the SVG from assistive technology using aria-hidden and provided a suitable aria-label on the button itself.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Next<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">type</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>button<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>svg</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-hidden</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>true<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">xmlns</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>title</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>chevronLeft<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    ...\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>svg</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>So accessible names are very important for users to understand what the various controls on the page do.</p>\n<h2>Be careful though</h2>\n<p>This does mean that you can do things like override the visible contents of the element with a different accessible name, which can lead to issues.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/bbc-register.png\" alt=\"A website form with a continue button.

as the <code>aria-label</code> has overridden the content‐derived accessible name.</p>\n<p>For a screen‐reader user who can see (many screen‐reader users are not fully blind), this can be a bit confusing as the visible and audible messaging is different.</p>\n<p>For a speech‐recognition user it is frustrating as they will try to say &quot;Click 'continue'&quot; which will not work because the software has been told the accessible name for this button is &quot;Next&quot;.</p>\n<p>I've seen worse examples, where the meaning of the visual label was completely different to the accessible name and would have caused serious issues in a user's journey.</p>\n<p>WCAG even has a criterion to cover this called &quot;Label in name&quot; to ensure the visible text is included in the accessible name.</p>\n<h2>Manipulating accessible names for good</h2>\n<p>But occasionally it can be useful to have a different accessible name from the visible one.</p>\n<p>If you have a number of links which have similar functionality, but where adding unique visible text to each item might make the interface cluttered or confusing for other users, you can use certain techniques to provide different values to different groups of users.</p>\n<p>For example, given a page where you have lots of article summaries each with a &quot;Read more&quot; link.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/blog-posts.png\" alt=\"A couple of blog post summaries showing a typical layout, each with a headline, some teaser copy and a read more link.\" />\n<figcaption>A typical blog arrangement.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Dynamites awards in pictures<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Teaser content ...<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Read more<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The issue here is that a screen‐reader user would not be able to distinguish the purpose of the links when viewing the links in isolation (this is one way screen‐reader users navigate a page).</p>\n<p>They will see a list of &quot;Read more&quot; and will have to go into the content to find out which one they need to follow to get to the article they want:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">Read more\nRead more\nRead more\n</code></pre>\n<p>But making the links more contextual like &quot;Read more Dynamites awards in pictures&quot; would make the interface overloaded and repetitive, helping one group to the detriment of another.</p>\n<p>We need a way to satisfy both and one way to do this is with an <code>aria-label</code> to modify the accessible name, like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Dynamites awards in pictures<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Teaser content ...<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Read more Dynamites awards in pictures<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Read more<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This keeps the visual the same but makes the links make sense to screen‐reader users as they will see a list of links like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">Read more Dynamites awards in pictures\nRead more Voices of our veterans on Remembrance Day\nRead more Robin helps OC deliver on hybrid working\n</code></pre>\n<p>It also still works for speech recognition users. As we have kept the visible label in the accessible name, the user can still say &quot;click 'read more'&quot; and the software will place a number next to each link to allow them to pick the one they want.</p>\n<h2>Using multiple sources</h2>\n<p>You can even reuse existing content to build an accessible name by using <code>aria-labelledby</code>. This takes a list of IDs of elements and constructs an accessible name based on the order of the IDs.</p>\n<p>This allows you to re‐use content (with all the advantages and pitfalls that gives). In the example below I'm creating the same accessible name, but using the <code>h3</code> and link content to concatenate into one phrase.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h3</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">id</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>article1-title<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Dynamites awards in pictures<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Teaser content ...<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">id</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>article1-more<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-labelledby</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>article1-more article1-title<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Read more<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bear in mind that any use of aria requires more testing with screen‐reader and voice-recognition software to ensure it works as expected. If you can get away without using aria, that is often the better option.</p>\n<h2>Adding context without aria</h2>\n<p>Actually what I'd recommend is using some extra HTML and CSS to achieve the same result, like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>Edit<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>span</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>visually-hidden<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span> thing one<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This uses a CSS class which hides the content visually, but crucially not from assistive technology, and achieves the same effect as the <code>aria-label</code> whilst being a more robust solution.</p>\n<h2>Placement of non-visible contextual content</h2>\n<p>The critical thing with speech recognition users and editing an accessible name to add context is that only added to the <em>end</em> of the visible label. Speech recognition software varies in ability to search for content and most don't respond well to the visible content not being the first content in the accessible name.</p>\n<p>For example if you have a link like</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>change name<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>and you want to add some context, don't do this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Bob change name<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>change name<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>or this</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>change Bob's name<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>change name<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>as most speech recognition software won't make the match when a user says &quot;Click 'change name'&quot;.</p>\n<p>Instead add the new content to the end of the visible label:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">href</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>change name Bob<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>change name<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to learn more about how different speech-recognition software handles contextual content in an accessible name, <a href=\"/posts/links-hidden-copy-and-voice-recognition\">I wrote up some findings from some testing</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wrap up</h2>\n<p>Accessible names are how you communicate the meaning of the interface to your users and getting it right is really important.</p>\n<p>If you have any doubt as to what the accessible name is for an item, most browser developer tools now have an accessibility panel which shows you the computed value.

      "value": "\n      <p>There are a few things to consider when thinking of colour and accessibility, but it generally comes down to one thing - can the user see what you are intending them to see?</p>\n<p>If the user can't make out the text because it falls under the required contrast ratios, it is effectively not there for that user.</p>\n<p>Making colours accessible can sometimes be seen as an unwanted constraint on creativity, but there are so many colours available that by seeing accessibility as a design philosophy it both reduces the possibilities to a more manageable number and gives a reason for using a particular shade over another.</p>\n<p>For example, Slack used to have a palette of 132 colours until they did an accessibility review which enabled them to reduce it down to a much more manageable 18 colours.</p>\n<h2>Contrast</h2>\n<p>One of the most talked about is colour contrast. At its most basic this is making sure that a colour is clearly distinguishable from the surrounding colour so the item is clearly perceivable to the user. For example, making sure a font colour has a good contrast against the page background (anyone else remember that phase of web design where everything was small grey text on a white background?).</p>\n<p>Contrast is important not only for users with reduced visual acuity, but good contrast helps when screen brightness is reduced (for example with battery saver options) or when viewing a screen in bright sun.</p>\n<p>Colour contrast can be measured as a ratio and this is what you will often cited in accessibility reports or on contrast checkers, but generally you want at least 4.5:1 for text content and 3:1 for non-text content (to meet WCAG AA), but bear in mind these are the minimum and you want to be far exceeding these values (the higher the first number the better as the more clear it will be to the user). The WCAG AAA ratio for text contrast is 7:1, so aim for this instead.</p>\n<p>Remember these ratios are also important for the various <em>states</em> of the items, so consider colour contrast when looking at focus and hover states too. You don't want a link which appears to disappear when the user tabs to it, and you also want the various states to be obvious when triggered.</p>\n<p>Whilst contrast is most commonly linked to text it is also crucial for interface elements. Well defined borders on things like form inputs ensure users can perceive the element itself, important when there is no other indication (like text for a button).</p>\n<p>Also pay attention to mixed colour backgrounds, such as when text is overlaid on images. Even if the component is designed with a more subdued image to allow the text to have good contrast, be aware that as the layout shifts based on the viewport, the position of the image in relation to the text may also move. Where the text once overlaid a contrasting part of the image may no longer be the case and the contrast may have suffered.</p>\n<p>Colour as information\nColour is also something which shouldn't be used in isolation to convey information - for example saying &quot;credits are shown in green and debits in red&quot;, or just using a red outline to mark an error on a form input is not helpful. As not everyone perceives colour in the same way (various forms of colour-blindness are very common) it is important that text labels are also used to present the meaning, and it is the meaning which is referred to rather than the colour.</p>\n<p>Similarly, just identifying links with a colour can leave users struggling to identify them, so consider keeping the underlines unless it is in a section of the page where it is obvious it is a link (such as a navigation area).</p>\n<p>As such, colour should always be a secondary consideration. The simplest way to check something still makes sense is to view it in greyscale which you can do using Chrome's rendering options in devTools, or in MacOS's colour filters (under Accessibility in System Prefs).</p>\n<h2>Colour-blindness</h2>\n<p>Speaking of colour-blindness, there is a misconception that red/green colour-blindness just means you can't 'see' the difference between red and green. In fact it causes issues with any colour which uses red or green as a constituent part, for example purple. So the likelihood is many colours will actually look different to a user with this condition.</p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that colour-blindness is not binary but has a spectrum of severity in the different types. There are emulators such as in the Chrome developer tools Rendering panel, but these show examples only (I've not found two emulators which agree on how something would be perceived). What they do show however is how different types of colour-blindness can also affect how effective colour contrast is, another reason why you want to make your contrasts as high as possible.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind things other than the very common colour-blindness can affect colour perception. Most operating systems now include bedtime routine modes which change the colours emitted after a certain time to reduce blue-light exposure.</p>\n<h2>Backgrounds and inverted colours</h2>\n<p>Colour is sometimes used as a background to help define an area. Even where this background has good contrast against the surrounding area, because background colours are not included when using an inverted colour setting like Windows High Contrast this can be lost and important visual grouping lost.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, use a transparent border on the element which will be highlighted in the inverted colour scheme to define the area in an alternate but just as effective way.</p>\n<h2>Detrimental effects of colour choice</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, some users have problems using sites which have acres of bright white backgrounds, so look at the possibility of implementing a dark mode as an option. Similarly, some users may struggle with a dark scheme so allow them to choose a lighter option. These can be tied to the operating system's user preferences setting, but should always include a toggle to allow the user user to override this for the individual site if desired.</p>\n<p>Pure black on white can be difficult for some users with dyslexia, so look at using off-white and dark grey instead.</p>\n<p>Finally, colour can also draw attention and distract or simply be overwhelming, so be aware of how this might affect users.</p>\n\n    ",

      "value": "\n      <p>Being able to check some code changes or a design with a screen‐reader is a major part of understanding accessibility, but many people put it off as it is so daunting.</p>\n<p>It’s certainly understandable as most times you might see people using a screen‐reader they will have the speed turned up so high it is difficult to follow and they might jump around the page seemingly randomly.</p>\n<p>But, for the most basic of testing, a simple top to bottom run through the page, you only need to know one or two keys commands.</p>\n<h2>How screen‐readers move about a page</h2>\n<p>Before we get into starting up our screen‐reader, let’s think about how a screen‐reader will move you around the page.</p>\n<h3>Where am I?</h3>\n<p>The first thing you might want to know when you land on a page which you can’t see, is “am I on the right page?”. To help with this the first thing you will hear when a page loads is the contents of the page title element. This is why having the title contain the purpose of the page (ideally the same as the page's h1 ) as well as the site's name is a great idea.</p>\n<h3>Not your typical keyboard user</h3>\n<p>Yes, screen‐readers make use of the keyboard to navigate, but put away thoughts that you will be moving about the page by hitting the tab key. Doing that will only let you hear the interactive content (links, form inputs, buttons etc), so you wouldn't really be able to listen to an article by tabbing around.</p>\n<p>Instead you’ll be using the arrow keys to move up and down the page. As you move you will see an outline around content and this is a visual representation of what’s called the virtual cursor. This allows you to move by blocks of text, reading it aloud as you go, but will also read out extra information when you get to buttons, form inputs or other components.</p>\n<p>As you move around the page you will see the browser focus (that focus state you get when you tab about with a keyboard) move with you when you reach an interactive element like a link, but then get left behind as you carry on using the virtual cursor.</p>\n<h3>One long tube</h3>\n<p>As you move about with a screen‐reader you will notice that the reading order follows the code order. To a screen‐reader user the page is always one long tube of content - the visual layout doesn’t really matter - which is also why “directional content” (where you might refer to content “over to the right”) is discouraged (although “above” or “below” is generally ok).</p>\n<h3>Don’t sweat the content</h3>\n<p>You might hear some content read out differently to how you might expect. In general, don’t worry about this (or check with an experienced user) as screen‐reader users can have different settings depending on their preferences. In particular reference numbers is one area where we see developers trying to force the screen‐reader to read it out in a particular way, not realising that all screen‐readers allow users to move character-by-character if required, so they can easily check the exact details if they want.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself thinking more content is needed to help screen‐reader users understand an interface, the chances are they either don’t (again, check with an experienced user), or that content would help all users, or the interface may need to be reworked.</p>\n<h2>Mac users</h2>\n<p>If you are a Mac user then you already have a screen‐reader installed called Voiceover.</p>\n<p>Most screen‐readers work best with specific browsers and in Voiceover’s case that is Safari.</p>\n<p>You use Command + F5 to start (and importantly to stop) Voiceover.</p>\n<h2>Windows users</h2>\n<p>If you are on Windows, whilst there is a pre-installed screen‐reader called Narrator, it doesn’t have heavy usage so for testing I’d recommend using NVDA, which is a free download.</p>\n<p>Most screen‐readers work best with specific browsers and in NVDA’s case that is Chrome or Firefox.</p>\n<p>When you start NVDA it will appear as a tool tray icon near the date and time, you may need to expand the tool tray to see it. You stop NVDA just like any other application.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/nvda-tray.png\" alt=\"Windows' system tray showing the expanded view with the purple and white NVDA icon\" />\n<figcaption>NVDA as a tray icon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Clicking on the icon will allow you to access the various settings.</p>\n<details>\n    <summary>There are a couple of setting changes which I recommend you make to NVDA.</summary>\n    <div>\n        Don’t be tempted to change any other settings whilst modifying these as it makes it more difficult to replicate issues and you can introduce unintended side-effects.\n<p><h3>Change the voice</h3>\nThe default one is very robotic and quite difficult to listen to</p>\n<p>Go to “Preferences”, then “Settings”, then “Speech”. Try out some of the synthesizers from the drop-down. Different voices using that synthesizer are available from the voices drop-down below it.</p>\n<p>I find the Windows OneCore Hazel voice to be quite good, but try a few out and find one which you are happy listening to.</p>\n<p><figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/nvda-voice.png\" alt=\"NVDA's settings with the speech panel active showing a drop-down of different voices\" />\n<figcaption>Where to find the voice options</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p><h3>Turn off Say All</h3>\nThis stops NVDA from just reading out the whole page as soon as it loads.</p>\n<p>“Preferences”, then “Settings”, then “Browse Mode” and uncheck the “Automatic say all on page load” option.</p>\n<p><figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/nvda-say-all.png\" alt=\"NVDA's settings with the browse mode panel open showing the location of the Say All option\" />\n<figcaption>Where to find the Say All setting</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p><h3>Turn off Mouse Tracking</h3>\nThis prevents NVDA reading out whatever is under your mouse cursor which makes it really easy to lose your place when testing things.</p>\n<p>To turn this off go to “Preferences”, then “Settings”, then “Mouse” and uncheck “Enable mouse tracking”.</p>\n<p><figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/nvda-mouse.png\" alt=\"NVDA's settings showing the Mouse options\" />\n<figcaption>Where to find the Mouse Tracking set</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p></div></p>\n</details>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>We’ll pick a simple (and well built) site to test our new screen‐reader skills. Open Welcome to GOV.UK  in the recommended browser and turn on your screen‐reader (you can use your mouse to place focus on the page, but once you have done that just use the keyboard).</p>\n<p>The first thing you will notice is an outline around the element the screen‐reader is focussed on (remember this can be anything, including the whole page). This is the virtual cursor and will show you what the screen‐reader is talking about as you move about.</p>\n<p>Before we start moving about, one useful key command to know is Ctrl - this stops the screen‐reader talking, until you navigate again. It can be very useful!</p>\n<p>Let’s try just moving through the page.</p>\n<p>If you are using Voiceover you will use Ctrl + Option + right arrow to move down the page (note, if the black outline is on the whole page, you might need to enter the page first by hitting Ctrl + Option + shift + down arrow - don’t worry, that’s the most complex combo you will need!). To move back up the page switch out the right arrow key for the left arrow key.</p>\n<p>If you are using NVDA you just need to use the down arrow. To move back up simply use the up arrow key.</p>\n<p>That’s it - that’s the basic navigation for using a screen‐reader!</p>\n<h2>Navigating by headings</h2>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it can take a long time to read through all of a page like this. So let’s add in one shortcut, navigating by headings.</p>\n<p>For Voiceover you can use Ctrl + Alt + Cmd + h to jump from heading to heading, NVDA users have it a lot easier as they can just hit the h key to do the same. Add in the shift key to reverse the direction.</p>\n<p>You will hear the heading level read out as you do this and this highlights the importance of getting your heading hierarchy right as navigating by headings is a good technique for someone to get a mental layout of a page and its content and how it all relates to each other.</p>\n<h2>Keep going</h2>\n<p>Now you have started with your screen‐reader of choice, carry on learning the basics - I wrote 3 screen‐reader beginner’s guides for HMRC (for NVDA, Voiceover and JAWS) which take you through everything from how understand what the screen‐readers are saying, to viewing lists of links and headings, how to navigate tables and more.</p>\n\n    ",

      "value": "\n      <p>Whilst this is a simple check to do, it actually covers several WCAG criteria because is such a core accessibility concern.</p>\n<h2>Mac users</h2>\n<p>If you are a Mac user, oddly <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2014/10/03/link-tabbing-firefox-osx.html\">tabbing in webpages is turned off by default</a>. This will affect Safari (though it seems not to on later builds) and Firefox.</p>\n<p>Before OS 13: <code>System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts</code> and check “Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls”.</p>\n<p>OS 13 on: <code>System Preferences &gt; Keyboard</code> and toggle on “Keyboard navigation”.</p>\n<h2>Navigating</h2>\n<p>Use the <kbd>tab</kbd> key to navigate around just the interactive elements on the page. You can use <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> to activate buttons and <kbd>enter</kbd> to activate links. Some components might require <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys - radio button groups show focus on <kbd>tab</kbd> and then you can use <kbd>space</kbd> to select that radio or use <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys to move up and down the list.</p>\n<p>Check if there is a <code>skip link</code> - an in‐page link at the top of the page which takes you to the main content and means you don't have to tab‐key your way through all the primary navigation on every page.</p>\n<p>Do all the things which allow interaction (link, buttons, form elements etc) get focus when you tab to them?</p>\n<p>Can you reach everything you can interact with using a mouse with your keyboard instead?</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/trainline.png\" alt=\"Website with a button highlighted in the page and in the devtools. DevTools shows the button has a tabindex set to minus 1\" />\n<figcaption>The Trainline website showing controls which cannot be reached by keyboard. In this case it is due to use of a negative tabindex. <a href=\"/assets/images/posts/full-size/trainline.png\" target=\"_blank\">See larger image (new tab).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Seeing where your focus is</h2>\n<p>Keyboard use relies heavily on being able to see where the focus currently is. If this is taken away by css or obscured (or just forgotten about) it can make it very difficult to work out where you are on the page. Making focus states really obvious (and importantly contrast well against non-focus states) helps as focus can jump across large sections of the page.</p>\n<p>Is there a good focus indicator for all the interactive content? Something which catches your eye easily so you can find it on a page.</p>\n<p>If you can't see where the focus went, you need to check if this is just down to a poor focus state or because the focus has gone to content which has been hidden from view - something you will often find when content has been hidden off-screen until triggered (like a menu).</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/lookers.png\" alt=\"A website with a focus shown floating in the middle of the page, apparently on nothing. Another screenshot shows there is a hidden menu which has got the focus.\" />\n<figcaption>A car dealer site showing how focus has gone to a hidden ‘mega-menu’ which is full of links. Whilst this will cause confusion in hiding the focus, it also shows it hasn’t been hidden correctly. This means keyboard users will have to tab through a lot of links to get to some of the primary navigation options. <a href=\"/assets/images/posts/full-size/lookers.png\" target=\"_blank\">See larger image (new tab).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Make sure you check the page in both desktop and mobile/tablet view. External keyboards are commonly paired to smaller devices and desktops can display the mobile view when the page is zoomed. Keyboards are often ignored when designing for mobile unfortunately.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/marks-and-spencer.png\" alt=\"The Marks and Spencer homepage in tablet view with an icon shown forced to focus state but with no indicator visible\" />\n<figcaption>M&S website’s menu icon has no focus indicator. <a href=\"/assets/images/posts/full-size/marks-and-spencer.png\" target=\"_blank\">See larger image (new tab).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Logical order</h2>\n<p>Does the order in which the links, buttons etc get focus make sense? It is all too easy to use css like grid to change the visual order of content, or use html like <code>tabindex</code> to force the focus order without checking how this affects other users. A focus indicator jumping around a page haphazardly can be confusing or frustrating for a user.</p>\n<p>Keyboard traps, where you find you cannot tab out of a component are not something you normally want. But occasionally they are desirable, like in the case of a modal dialog (often visually indicated by a dimming of the page behind it). With a dialog like this you want to keep the user within the dialog until they make some sort of decision and not to be able to break out and navigate the page behind.</p>\n<h3>Testing order with Firefox</h3>\n<p>You can test focus order visually using Firefox’s tab order option in developer tools. This will overlay numbers on the page showing where the focus will be placed.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/tabbing.png\" alt=\"Firefox's devtools showing the accessibility panel\" />\n<figcaption>The “Show Tabbing Order” option in Firefox’s Accessibility panel of devTools. <a href=\"/assets/images/posts/tabbing.png\" target=\"_blank\">See larger image (new tab).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/morrisons.png\" alt=\"Morrisons supermarket homepage with numbers overlaid showing where the focus lands and in what order\" />\n<figcaption>Morrisons website showing the Firefox “Show Tabbing Order” in action. <a href=\"/assets/images/posts/full-size/morrisons.png\" target=\"_blank\">See larger image (new tab).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>Testing order with activeElement</h3>\n<p>Overlays like Firefox’s are good but it can be tricky to track down a disappearing focus, especially in a crowded interface. You can be more targeted by using activeElement in the console. In Chrome’s console select Create live expression (the eye icon) and add <code>document.activeElement</code>. This will create a snippet which will follow focus in the page and allow you to both see where the focus is and what elements it is actually focussed on.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/thomas-cook.png\" alt=\"Thomas Cook website with an element highlighted on the page and devtools open showing the element and class list of the item which currently has focus.\" />\n<figcaption>activeElement in use showing where the focus lies, despite no visible focus on the page itself. <a href=\"/assets/images/posts/full-size/thomas-cook.png\" target=\"_blank\">See larger image (new tab).</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Managing focus</h2>\n<p>By this we mean, when focus is moved (not by the user), how is it handled? For example, clicking on a close icon in a dialog means you will be removing that icon from the page (as it is part of the dialog), so where does the focus end up? <a href=\"https://sarahmhigley.com/writing/focus-navigation-start-point/\">Browsers do try to help with this</a> when an element is removed, but as this doesn't account for screen‐readers, the focus needs to be managed to make a better user experience.</p>\n<p>Screen-magnification users can also set their view to follow the focus, so ensuring focus is managed well is also very important for these groups.</p>\n<p>In our dialog example we'd want focus to be returned to the thing which triggered the dialog, or if the dialog wasn't triggered by the user clicking something, back to whatever the user had focus on when it appeared. The trick is to try and be logical about it and keep it close to where the user's attention is.</p>\n<p>The more dynamic the page the more focus management will be needed and the more important keyboard testing becomes.</p>\n<h2>Checking everything works</h2>\n<p>As most developers build and test with a mouse it is all too easy to forget that not everyone can (or wants to) use one. So you can find buttons which only respond to a mouse click, effectively blocking a user from continuing.</p>\n<p>So, can you complete the task with just a keyboard? At the most basic level this means can the user activate all the links, buttons and other interactive elements (including things like video players) on the page and complete any forms.</p>\n<p>If you have any scrollable areas then make sure these can gain focus themselves to allow a keyboard user to be able to scroll the content, otherwise the content inside might not be reachable.</p>\n\n    ",

      "value": "\n      <p>An often-used technique for ensuring links to different targets have different accessible names (think of the classic &quot;Read more&quot; links on a blog), is to add some &quot;contextual&quot; content. This is so that screen‐reader users, who might be viewing a list of links extracted from the page by their screen‐reader software, won't have to guess at where a link might take them and can instead action the link directly from that list.</p>\n<p>However if not done well this can have a deterimental impact on other users, in-particular speech-recognition users.</p>\n<p>If you are reliant on speech-recognition software your primary interaction model is likely going to be saying &quot;Tap (or click) [name of the thing on the screen]&quot;. So if a button has the text &quot;Submit&quot; on it, you might say &quot;Tap submit&quot; and the software will action the button.</p>\n<p>Where this becomes more tricky is where the accessible name (the thing the speech-recognition software is waiting to hear) has been modified and no longer matches the visible name. This is exactly what we are doing when we add screen‐reader &quot;only&quot; contextual information to a link or other element.</p>\n<p>General guidance is always to append the hidden copy to the visible copy to make it less problematic for speech-recognition users. But how exactly do other placements of this new copy affect the speech-recognition user's experience?</p>\n<p>What I tested with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iOS Voice Control on iPad (7 gen) running 14.6 on Safari</li>\n<li>Android Voice Access on Pixel 2 running Android 11 on Chrome 92.0.4515.131</li>\n<li>Dragon on Windows 10 on IE11</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dragon seems to find the best match, front-loading the wording vocalised by the user. If saying &quot;click account&quot; it would pick the 3 links on the page with &quot;account&quot; in the visible name (but won't also flag the ones with &quot;account&quot; in the hidden copy alongside them). It also can search hidden copy - for example try saying &quot;click of account&quot;.</p>\n<p>Previous testing also suggests Dragon will search attributes for a match, so it will search in this order, stopping once it finds hits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>visible text</li>\n<li>hidden text</li>\n<li>attributes - further testing needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the examples below the phrasing &quot;tap&quot; is used for ease of writing, but this might be &quot;click&quot; instead if the speech-recognition is using mouse-style input rather than touch-screen.</p>\n<h2>Standard link</h2>\n<p>For control purposes.

The project's main navigation bar had changed from a single horizontal bar to one requiring a sub-menu. Before we get started, <a href=\"/demos/twotiernav/\">have a quick look at the finished menu</a>.</p>\n<h2>No drop-downs</h2>\n<p>The first decision I made was that I didn't want to use vertical drop-downs for the sub-menus. When a tab was selected I wanted the sub-menu to be fixed in place, allowing quick movement between sections. So these sub-menus would be horizontal, sitting under the main bar. Of course being a good semantic junkie the menu would be marked up as nested lists:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token

'selected' state when you are on a page within that section (done with server-side class assignment)</li>\n<li>all tabs (except the 'selected' one) to have a 'hover' state (done with basic css)</li>\n<li>the 'selected' tab's submenu should be visible by default (the resting state is done as part of 1. but we need to do a bit of work to 'reset' it)</li>\n<li>as you hover over the other tabs, their submenus should replace that of the 'selected' submenu</li>\n<li>as you move into a submenu, its parent tab should retain its appropriate colour ('selected' or 'hover')</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We'll accomplish items 3 - 5 with some jquery.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token function\">$</span><span class=\"token

href=\"/demos/twotiernav/sofar.html\">what we have so far</a>. Now you'll see we have a bit of an issue, especially with the Support and Blog submenus. The position of the tabs to the submenu items means it can be tough to make a selection without catching one of the neighbouring tabs.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/problem.jpg\" alt=\"The path a user's mouse would take from a tab to the sub-menu showing how it interacts with adjacent tabs\">\n<p>This isn't ideal and will be frustrating for users, what we want is the submenu to be centred under the relative tab. Now for most websites this would just be a matter of setting a left margin to the left-most submenu item and tada you're done. However that assumes the submenu won't change. Also for my particular application (an extranet), the submenu and top menu both change depending upon what your permissions are on the site, so I can never fix this by hard-coding. Luckily we have already opened our jquery toolbox and it is a pretty easy fix. This is what we're after:</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/solution.jpg\" alt=\"The sub-menu shown below the parent tab. With the sub-menu placed below the active tab the user's mouse has much less chance of unwanted interactions with other parts of the navigation\">\n<p>What we want to do is measure the distance from the left of the menu to the middle of the current tab (hover or selected), then measure the width of the related submenu divided by two, then take the latter value from the former and assign that as a left-margin. Phew! Here's a diagram which will explain it better:</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/maths.jpg\" alt=\"Letter A showing the distance from the left edge of the menu. Letter B indicates the with of the submenu. The distance the submenu needs to be moved is shown as A minus half B.\">\n<p>JQuery has the useful outerWidth method which gives you a numeric value of the full width of an element (as opposed to the width method which doesn't include padding).</p>\n<p>With this and a bit of traversing, you can get the measurements you need:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span

As a rule, it is a superficial book, but it swells the bulk and it indicated the cerebral unrest that is trying to express itself. We have arrived at a condition in which more books are printed than the world can read. This is true not only of books that are not worth reading, but it is true of the books that are.</p>\n<p>All this I take to be the result of an intellectual affranchisement that is new, and of a dissemination of knowledge instead of concentration of culture. Everybody wants to say something. But it is slowly growing upon the world that everybody has not got something to say. Therefore one may even at this moment detect the causes which will produce reaction. In 100 years there will not be so many books printed, but there will be more said. That seems to me to be inevitable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you replace book with blog, <a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/5/18/predictions-for-1993-1893.html\">this chap</a> has the current state of play down to a tee. Even down to the realisation that not everyone writing something is worth reading, but also that there are so many good writers that you just can't keep up.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/book.jpg\" alt=\"\" >\n<p>This totally mirrors my online reading habits at the moment. I've gone from a huge selection of websites in my rss reader to a very select few. Additionally the frequency with which I check them has dropped from checking every day to maybe once a week or fortnight. Mainly I think I have Twitter to thank for this. By selecting the right people to follow I can quickly dip into any breaking industry news or new techniques as it's guaranteed at least one of those people will tweet it. The remainder of the posts in my rss feed can now be saved for later as I know they are unlikely to be time-sensitive. Ironically, as the time I have to catch up on these posts tends to be when I'm away from my computer, I <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamliptrot/sets/72157615389861043/\">publish them</a> into slim books (via Lulu and only for my use), but at least I know these writings are worth reading.</p>\n\n    ",

I’d been thinking about setting up a blog about the process for a while and have finally got around to it. Luckily, over the past few months I’d been pretty good at taking photographs to document it all and had uploaded them to Flickr.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/incayellow.jpg\" alt=\"Inca Yellow screenshot\">\n<p>Now, I’ve used <a href=\"http://expressionengine.com/\">Expression Engine</a> before and this was my first thought when I sat down to put my MG blog together. However it did seem a bit of overkill for what I wanted and I’d been there, done that and wanted to try something a bit different.</p>\n<p>As I’d been uploading all my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamliptrot/sets/72157603651163453/\">MG photos</a> to Flickr and knowing that their photo description field allows a limited but totally sufficient set of html tags coupled with a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/services/api/\">nice API</a> (even though it’s <a href=\"http://morethanseven.net/2008/02/21/sorry-but-the-flickr-api-isnt-rest/\">not RESTful</a>), I decided to try using Flickr as a blog engine.</p>\n<p>Before I go on, take a quick look at the result: <a href=\"http://www.incayellow.com/\">IncaYellow.com</a>. [Editors note from 2023 - the site is no longer running on the Flickr API.]</p>\n<p>The Flickr API is really pretty nice to work with. However, it can be a touch slow so I added in a bit of server-side caching to save visitors having to wait too long. For example, this is pulling in the individual photo information with a little bit of simple caching:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token

Using a couple of other Flickr API methods and the <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/api\">Delicious API</a> meant I could pretty much reproduce a full-on blog, complete with archives and tag pages.</p>\n<p>Now obviously this wouldn’t suit most blogs, but I knew that my posts would be pretty short and always be accompanied by a photo, so I was set.</p>\n<p>There are a few enhancements I’ve got in mind for the next few weeks. The main one is being able to add more than one photo for a given post, especially for those more tricky mechanical jobs. This seems like a perfect opportunity to use machine tags to relate photos to each other and by adding something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token literal-property property\">incayellow</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span>post<span class=\"token operator\">:</span><span class=\"token constant\">PHOTOID</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>to a photo, I could pull in all the other photos to do with that job. Comments are another nice-to-have, so I’ll be building that in too. I’ll also be tweaking the caching timing over time to find the optimal period to keep data for (it’d be nice to have the cache refresh for new posts). The other thing I just haven’t got around to yet is an RSS feed. I could just use the Flickr RSS feed, but that just seems lazy, so I’ll most likely roll my own. Also on the horizon is a 404 page, just because I think you should always have one.</p>\n\n    ",

      "value": "\n      <p>I was at the first event run by the amiable Keir and Glenn under the banner of <a href=\"http://www.wfwp.co.uk/\">Workshops for Web People</a> in Leicester last week, featuring <a href=\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/\">Andy Clarke‘s</a> follow-on presentation for his <a href=\"http://www.transcendingcss.com/\">Transcending CSS</a> book. A well done to both the lads and Andy for putting on a great day and keeping everyone entertained and full of food and drink.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/malarkey.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Clarke in workshop pose\" >\n<p>Andy spent some time looking at CSS3 and where certain aspects of it can be used right now. One feature is that of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/\">media queries</a>. These are a series of features such as width, height, aspect-ratio and resolution with min- or max- prefixes, which enable the serving of css tailored to specific devices. Andy showed and example where a media query could be used to serve up a separate layout for mobile devices - specifically his iPhone.</p>\n<p>Inspired by this demo I decided to reproduce that on this site. My aim was for anyone viewing on a supporting browser to be served up an additional set of styles if their browser-window’s size would normally have given them scrollbars. In practice this meant adding the following code to my main css file where I import my other files:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@import</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"/assets/reset.css\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@import</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"/assets/screen.css\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@media</span> all <span class=\"token keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token property\">max-width</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 800px<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    ...additional styles…\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This translates as “when the device supports media all and is no wider than 800px, use these rules”.  You can try this with Safari (I’ve tested on Safari 3) and Opera (tested on 9.24) , though not Firefox, by resizing you browser to under 800px and hitting refresh. The refresh is required to activate the stylesheets, so it is not as robust a solution as one of the javascript options for this particular use, but it does provide an insight into how powerful CSS3 could be if we could get it out of the gate. The obvious applications are for mobile devices - especially those which don’t identify themselves as handheld, so by-pass the normal for-mobile styles.</p>\n<p>Note that trying to add this rule in a <code>&lt;link.. /&gt;</code> tag doesn’t seem to work as it gets applied by Firefox even when not matching the rules, it seems in that state the browser ignores the bit of the rule it doesn’t understand, proceeding to implement the bits it does.</p>\n\n    ",

This is my first download of a purchased book and I’m pleasantly surprised by the format.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/mobilewebdesign.jpg\" alt=\"The book\" >\n<p>The general thrust of the book is that the content should probably not be just your standard site (one of 4 possible options Cameron outlines), but rather a separate section or domain with content tailored to the user on the move (mobile referring to the user rather than the device). Contextualising what content people will want from your website via their phone is probably the most challenging part of mobile web design. It is quite possible that it is something which is not present on your primary domain, but this book gives you some good examples to help you get thinking in the right direction and using the phones unique abilities to full effect.</p>\n<p>This is not a technical reference, instead focusing on the greater picture, but Cameron gives plenty of links for additional reading, something which is important in what will possibly be many people’s first look at designing for mobile users. In all it was a great read, which I managed within a day, and anyone familiar with Cameron’s writing on his blog will feel right at home. Still not sure? The book site has a sample. Go download.</p>\n\n    ",

The final panel was opened up to the floor and a question was put forward regarding the future of education in web design in face of the amazing pace of new developments in the field. <a href=\"http://www.malarkey.co.uk/\">Andy Clarke‘s</a> reply was that if educational institutions cannot keep pace with developments then “perhaps we should see the death of institutionalised education” in web design.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/fowd_panel.jpg\" alt=\"The speaker panel at the conference\" >\n<p>The spontaneous applause which this got from the floor indicates the understanding of <a href=\"http://kurafire.net/articles/web-standards-and-educations\">how far behind schools, colleges and even some universities</a> are when compared to best industry practice. I can’t help but agree, but I know it will never happen.</p>\n<p>As long as there are people wanting to learn web design there will be educators trying to deliver it, especially with changes to funding models in the UK making every place on a course important. The problem I can see is one of hard-pressed teachers trying to fit a technical and pretty abstract subject into a small slot in the timetable. Of course the easiest thing is to go for the easy win and get the kids using a tool like Dreamweaver or FrontPage to knock something up quickly with no thought of the code behind the scenes. At least that way they have something to stick in a portfolio at the end of the day. And lets not forget that most web design courses come under the auspices of the IT department, when to get the results we aspire to it should be a joint venture between IT, Art and even Humanities.</p>\n<p>Teachers who commonly get landed with delivering a web design course typically are ill-equipped to do so at a level which will give their students an insight into the real work going on in the industry. Maybe this is where the industry should step in to help. We could produce lesson plans with accompanying teacher notes suitable for different lengths of course, just as they are available for other subjects. These could be updated with new technologies and changes to standards as unlike most subjects our industry is a fast-paced one which even full-time professionals sometimes have a hard time keeping up with, let alone hard-pressed teaching staff. We could produce some outstanding sample sites which could be broken down into their component parts complete with notes for use as teaching aids. We could even come up with a network of web design firms who would be open to have student placements or come into class for a guest speaker session. I’m sure that with a little effort the firms which put a bit of effort in could end up with an endless supply of new talent from these sources.</p>\n<p>Of course it can’t be all one-way. We need the teachers to let us in. Just as we recognise their abilities when it comes to communicating an idea to young minds, they need to see that accepting help from us is not a threat to their teaching skills. It needs to be a partnership else we risk continuing on our current insane course where teachers are delivering outmoded classes to students who won’t know any different until they’re in the industry - if they ever make it that far.</p>\n\n    ",

It is really good to see an event in the top half of the country - even if it did mean a 5am start to get up there in time! Fortunately I was on the train with fellow Highland Fling-ers <a href=\"http://morethanseven.net/\">Gareth</a> and Mark who prevented me from falling asleep and missing my stop. A short walk to the Symposium Hall in the Royal College of Surgeons gave us a quick glimpse of Edinburgh before the conference started.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alanwhitewebdevelopment.com/\">Alan</a> had managed to gather an impressive group of speakers for the inaugrual Fling, with Jeremy Keith kicking off events with an introduction to the concepts of progressive enhancement (via chair design and the zx81). All the speakers managed to pitch their slots at the right level, with not too much in the way of coding tutorials but lots of useful debate and theoreticals. Andy Budd in particular gave a great presentation on CSS3 and why it is taking so long for the next recommendation (CSS2.1) to get out of the draft phase.</p>\n<p>Mark Norman Francis covered how Yahoo uses graded browser support, despite suffering from a cold; Christian Heilmann and James Edwards covered Javascript and Ajax from 2 slightly opposing viewpoints - both compelling arguments; Drew McLellan ran through microformats and the potential use as an API; and Andy Clarke finished off with a talk about the future including a reveal of the new Stuff and Nonsense design.</p>\n<p>Whislt lunch wasn’t provided, the location of the conference meant there were plenty of places to grab some good food - I can now recommend Black Medicine Coffee Co. which had great smoothies and free wifi. Coffee and biscuits were put on in both breaks and Alan even managed to provide some excellent swag! As usual all the speakers excelled and both they and Alan should be congratulated on a great day out which was fantastic value for money. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamliptrot/sets/72157600053280575/\">More photos on Flickr.</a></p>\n<p>Here’s to next year!</p>\n\n    ",

Microsoft have decided to remove the IE rendering engine and replace it with Word’s rather more poor one. In doing so they are pushing HTML emails back to the days of HTML 4.01 and CSS1 - those specs were last updated over 8 years ago. You’ve got to admit their timing sucks, just as IE finally gets a whole lot better, they decide to rip it out.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/apple.gif\" alt=\"A complex HTML email from Apple\" >\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338201.aspx#Word2007MailHTMLandCSS_SupportedHTMLElementsAttributesandCSSProperties\">supported items</a> and you’ll see there are no background images or css floats and positioning. How does this affect us? Well, it’s kinda like the browser position in the bad old days, if you are trying to push forward with CSS-based emails, you will be in for some headaches as they have made it pretty much impossible to do this. As <a href=\"http://joe.hardy.id.au/blog/2006/11/21/broken-html-rendering-in-outlook-2007/\">Joe Hardy notes</a>, even though align is supported, glitches make it useless - and the problems don’t stop there, check out his article for all the nasties. As Outlook is the primary company email client and comes with every Windows PC, it remains the most important email client out there for better or worse. The <a href=\"http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html\">Campaign Monitor</a> crew have a screenshot comparison of their CSS email newsletter in the Outlook 2000 and 2007 to show the difference the change of rendering engine really means.</p>\n<p>Yes we could argue about whether HTML belongs in email, but many people expect it to be there - both clients and customers - that the view of developers is really not an issue. You cannot ignore that a graphical email has a lot more impact than a text-only one (assuming that the email client does not block the images by default, or the customer has the awareness to unblock them). Personally I think the decision to use HTML or text should be ruled by the content. HTML emails are particularly suited to e-commerce where the product is what the customer wants to see - Apple’s emails are a good example of these. Text-only emails are similarly effective where pure information is key - job board updates, blog newsletters and such. Like it or not HTML emails will continue to be requested and Microsoft have now made it more difficult to do this in a way that moves us forward.</p>\n<p>They had a great opportunity to use the IE7 engine in Outlook, but instead have forced us to roll back our designs back to either fully table-based or text-based instead of the graceful degradation that CSS support could give us.</p>\n\n    ",

The <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\">iPhone</a> was among a slew of products the various pundits hoped would be announced in Steve Jobs’ keynote address at the San Francisco MacWorld conference, although pretty much the whole of the keynote was given over to this and the previously announed iTV. This meant no immediately announced updates to hardware (except a new Airport), no iWork 07 and an iTV which had the most basic feature list (although still darn cool and sure to be built upon).</p>\n<p>The iPhone looks like a great piece of kit, combining a full web browser (Safari) a mail client, wireless and bluetooth access, photo software (all running on OSX), and of course a video iPod. That last bit shouldn’t be a surprise as it is Apple’s killer app for this type of hardware and the thing they have over their competitors in the smartphone market. I think we’ll see all the major players move to the touch-screen interface in the coming months as Apple’s share of customers increases, though it is interesting they moved away from the clickwheel interaction for the iPod part of the phone.</p>\n<p>We may also be seeing the first device which popularises the mobile web with the inclusion of a slightly tweaked Safari browser, giving people a consistent experience as they move from desktop to iPhone as it syncs your bookmarks between the two.

In addition to currently selling off DropSend , launching Hey Amigo and running Vitamin and Carson Workshops, he has taken the Future of Web Apps conference from London into the States. Now he’s expanding his events portfolio to include the <a href=\"http://www.carsonified.com/biz-tips/learning-about-new-business-models\">recently</a> announced <a href=\"http://www.futureofwebdesign.com/\">Future of Web Design</a>. How I wish he’d launched that before I’d spent my conference budget for the year!</p>\n<p>From the looks of it, the new event will cater for the more UI-centred aspect of web development of typography, layouts and branding (I think I can guess a few of the speakers already), as opposed to the more wide-ranging Apps conference. This is great as the design-type sessions at atmedia this year were heavily attended and showed that there is definitely a demand for this.</p>\n<p>We’ve gone from having no large web conferences in the UK to having atmedia, dconstruct and the Future of ... in the space of a couple of years. It’s going to get to the point where I either can’t make them all or have to self-fund my way around. It’s a nice problem to have.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you think you can make it to London in April, go and sign up, registration fr FoWD opens 18th January. If it is anything like last year’s FoWA or if the line-up is a strong as the upcoming one it should be a cracking day.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Unfortunately I’ll be missing this year’s FoWA conference as I’ll be out the country, but I definitely be looking forward to FoWD.</p>\n\n    ",

Don’t let this put out off if you don’t count yourself as either of these as Paul covers a wide range of topics and there will generally be something to pique your interest.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.dl.tv/\">dl.tv</a></h2>\n<p>The only one I don’t listen to on the move as it’s a video. Patrick Norton and Robert Heron cover all things gadetry from HD tvs to Vista to digital French rabbits.

All good so far, until I had to create a password to go with my personal information. Now most sites stipulate a pasword between say 6 and 12 characters, sometimes requiring letters and numbers if they’re being concious about security. Not so insuresupermarket.com. No, they require exactly 8 characters, letters and numbers, and no characters to recurr more than twice. I have to say I was hard-pressed to come up with a password that I’d remember which matched these tight requirements. This coming at the end of a long form-filling exercise is not the best way to garner repeat customers.</p>\n<p>Ironically I now can’t find anywhere on their site to retrieve a saved quote.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/images/posts/car_password_error.gif\" alt=\"Browser alert box which says your password must contain exactly 8 characters and a whole lot of other complex rules\" >\n<p>Not only that but their form validation only validates one field at a time, meaning that if you miss a couple of required fields you can end up having to resubmit the same form several times.</p>\n<p>Thank goodness this is a once-per-year event.</p>\n<h2>Response from insuresupermarket</h2>\n<p>Andy Haigh, Insuresupermarket Product Manager, kindly responded to this post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Adam, I agree with your concern over the password complexity that we use on our Motor Insurance site. In fact we have recently being making changes to improve this and this will be going live very soon now. However, let me explain why we have such tight constraints on our password and what it is used for:</p>\n<p>We use the password that the user enters for 2 reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the user to retrieve their saved quote from some of the insurers sites</li>\n<li>we also email you a link to our results quote page and the password is used by the user to access this</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue that we face as an aggregator, is that the insurers use a range of constraints on their password validation. This means that the password our user selects needs to meet the password constraints of ALL the insurers where we pass through the password from our site to the insurers sites. It would be much nicer if the insurers used a common set of validation rules.</p>\n<p>The improvements to the password question went live yesterday (16 Nov). We now just use the password so that the user can retrieve their emailed results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n    ",

It will also develop training and certification and even create specialist fonts to use. Now all this costs money and Joe is looking for funding to enable him to go out and get the $7 million Canadian the project will need over the life of the project. He’s after $7,777 to enable him to devote all his time to fundraising for 4 months - so this is subsidence living - and is asking for help from the development community to help achieve this target. When you consider the size of the community and the sum needed I’m sure he’ll have no problem getting there, and having seen Joe’s enthusiasm I’m sure he’ll manage to get the project funding too.</p>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"http://openandclosed.org/\">Open &amp; Closed Project</a> to find out more and donate.</p>\n\n    ",

It’s only been up a couple of days so posts are still a little thin on the ground and I’m sure he’s still getting used to the idea. Design firm <a href=\"http://www.headlondon.com/\">Head London</a> have made a pretty good job of it all, and it fairly sings web 2.0. Everything is there - count them - Tag Cloud, Flickr feed, YouTube-style videos, guest blogs, widgets, PodCasts. Unfortunately there are a couple of non-Web2.0 code issues - a double doctype, inline styles and javascript in the hrefs, but it is light years ahead of what we would normally expect from a politician’s site.</p>\n<p>The design is nice and clean, keeping away from the oh-so-obvious party-blue, and giving us a site it is actually pleasurable to be on. There is even a video clip of a conversation between (I assume) a guy from Head London and Mr Cameron regarding the sections of the site which haven’t launched and how they were going to deal with the high volume of comments. Now I would have thought that they would have given this a bit of thought beforehand, making sure that the early adopters weren’t left hanging waiting for replies. I’m sure there are several people employed full-time just moderating the comments, which all have to be approved before publication.</p>\n<p>I hope that this site continues to be updated and isn’t left to be another fashion-following fad. Whether this is a good movement for politics itself I’m not sure - is it heading too far towards personality-led politics - but it does make the party more human, something which many large companies have already discovered.</p>\n\n    ",

Unfortunately for Dell, instead of talking about things the customers want to hear about through such a interactive medium, they have chosen to use it to wave the corporate flag. Product launches and back-patting seem the order of the day. That is not what a blog is about - you can have those as nice features on your company site. Blogs are about revealing the people behind the company and maybe the behind-the-scenes work they do, the reasons the company does what it does.</p>\n<p>For a company a large as Dell a blog is a golden opportunity to connect with their customers, find out what they want or what is causing them concern - much more so than any number of feedback questionnaires would. In a blog you can go back and ask for clarification and also be seen to be acting. Dell should be addressing customer support issues which seem to be the main complaint about them. Also they need to ensure their customers can find them - I could see no links to the blog from the main Dell site, even after using their search tool.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think it is a huge thing that Dell have decided to start blogging, but I hope they manage to keep it away from the in-your-face marketing people. This could do more for their reputation than their marketing dept could imagine if done right.</p>\n\n    ",

Looking at my bookshelf I can see at least 6 books authored by people who presented this year. Making next year's conference as good as this year's is going to be a real challenge. It was really great to see some familiar faces among the crowd and get to meet a bunch of new ones. The conference was split along two tracks which caused a good few people to wish they could split themselves in half and it meant some really tough decisions - how do you decide between <a href=\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/\">Andy Clarke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tantek.com/\">Tantek Celik</a>?</p>\n<p>Anyway here are my best bits:</p>\n<p>The WCAG panel encouraging people to actually read the 2.0 draft before making their mind up (and finding out about the quick references they've just put out); though most people agreed having <a href=\"http://joeclark.org/\">Joe Clark</a> there would have made it more of a debate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.veen.com/jeff/\">Jeff Veen's</a> 'Next Generation of Web Apps' presentation was the highlight of the whole conference and a great way to finish off day 1. I've always wanted to see Jeff speak as it was his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723700/qid=1150712536/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/203-0199538-5094339\">Art and Science of Web Design book</a> which gave me a huge leg-up in web design and he didn't disappoint, giving an inspiring look at the state of the industry, how far we've come and where we might be going next.</p>\n<p>The social calendar sprang back into action with Patrick managing to convince the bar to open up for football and after a win and a few drinks it was down to the Texas Embassy for food with <a href=\"http://www.morethanseven.net/\">Gareth</a> and <a href=\"http://thinkdrastic.net/\">Olly</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.simplebits.com/\">Dan Cederholm</a> kicked of day 2 with a look into making sites bulletproof with examples from his <a href=\"http://corkd.com/\">Cork'd</a> site and re-energised everyone after the excesses of the night before.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cameronmoll.com/\">Cameron Moll</a> told us how to look towards providing content to mobile devices and gave everyone some really useful tips to go away with. Yahoo!'s <a href=\"http://nate.koechley.com/blog/\">Nate Koechley's</a> look at how they implemented standards into 3 of their upcoming products shows us how far the community has come in the past couple of years. Chatting to him afterwards about microformats and social tagging, he came across as a really nice guy.</p>\n<p>Speaking of microformats, Tantek Celik enthused the whole lot of us with a run-down of what they are and the potential of them - along with examples of them out in the wild.</p>\n<p>The final session was a great light-hearted 'hot topics' panel most ably hosted by <a href=\"http://adactio.com/journal/\">Jeremy Keith</a> - a great way to round of the day, followed by beer in the pub (<a href=\"http://www.webexposia.com/\">CJ</a> - are you going to start importing UK beer to Canada?).</p>\n<p>What I noticed this year was a move towards more strategic thinking rather than nuts and bolts stuff. Also the presentations were without an exception amazing - from the crafted slides to the practiced speakers - coupled with a great venue this was a top class event. Congrats to Patrick and here's to @media 2007.</p>\n\n    ",

The <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview\">hReview</a> only requires the item being reviewed, but obviously for a review to be useful it needs a bit extra.</p>\n<p>As the power of microformats comes from them being pulled out of context (eg <a href=\"http://kitchen.technorati.com/search/\">Technorati’s new search tool</a>), I wanted to attach my name and url to the review.

Dates are something which have to be machine-readable and so must have a format which is common.</p>\n<p>This format is contained within the title attribute of the abbr tag, as it is effectively abbreviating the more readable ‘June 19th 2006’ or even ‘yesterday’. So we add the following after the link within the reviewer span:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token

Does this mean that the standards war is won? Well, no. WSA reached the 100-site milestone in January and Stylegala has had a distinct lack of new additions in the past few months. The WSA is much more along the lines of the Web Standards Project, the core of the site is the promotion of standards, with sites judged by the <a href=\"http://www.webstandardsawards.com/criteria/#WJudges\">great and the good of web design</a>. The annoucement says it all:</p>\n<blockquote>\n    It's no longer a myth that you can produce a stunning site with Web Standards\n</blockquote>\n<p>and the 100 site mark is a good place to bow out. Plus these guys have a lot of other stuff to do.</p>\n<p>Job done. War won? Nope, there are still an awful lot of sites out there partying like it's 1999, but the tide has turned. The WSA stands as a showcase to standard-compliant design. Stylegala on the other hand is a gallery, a place for inspiration, although it has actually been more than just a gallery for some time. However the gallery does seem to have fallen by the wayside since the heady days of March 2005 when 20 sites were added. In the past few months only a couple of sites have made it in, despite, as the WSA declares:</p>\n<blockquote>\n    beautiful sites with beautiful code are being produced by the hundreds; every month, every week, every day\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe the problem is that it is too difficult to seperate out just 10 sites a month to feature - what about the ones that don't make it, are they not worthy? This is probably why many recent sites have been high-profile ones (like <a href=\"http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php\">Verlee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uxmag.com/\">UX Magazine</a> which everyone can put on a pedestal. Stylegala looks like it has just been overwhelmed.</p>\n\n    ",

Congrats to <a href=\"http://tomsimcox.com/blog/\">Tom</a> and the University team for putting on a good event - with wine and nibbles too!</p>\n<p>Molly opened the show with a run-down of the history of standards on the web. It’s amazing how far the web has come in such a short time and having hand-coded many a table-based page in the early days, I don’t think I could ever go back to coding that way - in fact I think it would take me quite a while to remember all the tricks we used to have to employ to get the pages to work in the browsers of the day. She did a great overview of modern web standards and the Layer Cake way of coding - structure, content, presentation, behaviour - though every time she used the term, the film kept jumping into my head.</p>\n<p>An interesting thing to which Molly alluded was that even if the IE team got the browser up to spec. with all standards/recommendations, then they still have to ensure it plays nicely with Windows Vista and this requirement would overrule any standards in the case of conflict. Personally this is not something I’d even thought about having an impact on the development of IE. I could understand (to an extent) them not wanting to break all their big client’s sites, but this adds another dimension. I can’t imagine all the pressure the IE team are getting from all sides in the run-up to the launch of IE7.</p>\n<p>Molly also mentioned the use of microformats and their potential for the future of the web. After hearing them talked about at the Carson Summit they are something I’ll be taking more notice of.</p>\n<p>Andy’s talk focussed on the extent of user experience on the web. He illustrated the old way of doing things when trying to provide accessible content to as many people as possible - Betsie on the BBC and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/access\">Amazon Access</a>. His point was that these methods may provide the main content of the full version but provide none of the user experience which is available on the ‘full’ version.</p>\n<p>He then ran through the design of elements of <a href=\"http://www.karova.com/\">Karova store</a> and how they employed ‘Tesco testing’ to get some eye-opening usability data - in this case the difference in how men and women process on-scren layouts.</p>\n<p>Molly and Andy are great public speakers and a big thanks to them for making the effort to come to Newcastle.</p>\n\n    ",

This meant I had time do give my brain some downtime before ramming it full of more web knowledge again.</p>\n<p>Jeremy and the ClearLeft crew did a great job putting the event on, from greeting the attendees in the hotel lobby to providing an ad hoc wireless network.</p>\n<p>The morning was pimarily taken up with a review of Javascript syntax and an overview of DOM scipting and the Ajax proper started after lunch. The morning’s tutoring was definitely worth it though as Ajax relies on this to perform. Jeremy is a great speaker and managed to explain the ins and outs of Ajax in a way which cause a lightbulb to go on in my head at least a couple of times. As anyone who has seen him speak before or has read his book will know, he is a great advocate of unobtrusive scripting, using hooks in the code to tie in your javascript. He applies the same sort of graceful degredation to his Ajax coding.</p>\n<p>His approach is to code the application so it works as a traditional page with the page refreshes that entails. Then add in the Ajax to ‘Hijax’ the page, diverting the call to the Ajax code if the client browser supports it. This relies on the server-side architecture being coded in a modular way. What this means is that you can target the server-side code for a particular module within a page. This may require some change of coding methodology, but it will mean you only have to code it once for both standard calls and Ajax calls.</p>\n\n    ",

Joshua gave us 45 minutes chock-full of useful information on how to get the most out your servers (from using a proxy to throttle performance, to server caching); building an API (the main point being make it easy for people to get in and out of it by using a simple solution such as XML and not requiring an API key); and URL-rewriting.</p>\n<p>URL beautification became a common theme throughout the day as several of the talks urged for simple URLs. Joshua's reasoning was that they are the main marketing push for your site as they are copied and pasted everywhere.</p>\n<p>Other points</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't add features which replicate other well-used applications - eg personal messaging which is limited to a site - why not just use email instead?</li>\n<li>Don't give people the features they want - find the underlying problem they want to solve and give them what they need.</li>\n<li>Top 10 lists just encourage people to spam your site - people start focussing on the list position.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tagging was one of the most useful things Joshua discussed as it is something I'm looking at for a couple of projects. Interestingly del.icio.us was built out of a txt file based system Joshua had for bookmarking websites, which eventually distilled his descriptions down into one-word meaningful 'tags'. He urged people not to be tempted to auto-add tags for users as this removes the attention required to give meaningful tags - the transaction cost of having to add tags each time makes the tag system stronger (although don't overdo this cost). I'm glad he spoke against a forced vocab list for tags. His reasoning was that a tag will mean different things to different people and there is no way you can add a 'description' to each tag.</p>\n<p>He said make sure you measure useage of features over a period of time - if they are still using the feature long after it launched then it is a success. When testing for usability, don't give people tasks or goals as it makes them act totally different to how they would normally - they start reading everything on the screen.</p>\n<p>For marketing he said they didn't really do any - most of it was evangalising users and he points out that del.icio.us isn't a community site, the community exists outside on AIM and email and other communication methods. Del.icio.us doesn't own the community (along with all the pitfalls of hosting such a community).</p>\n\n    ",

      "value": "\n      <h2>Building Flickr</h2>\n<p>Cal looks at 10 things which he sees as being instrumental to Web 2.0 from the point of view of Flickr.</p>\n<h3>Collaboration</h3>\n<p>Allowing people to list friends on Flickr enables a social network to develop, making the site better for them and for you. In addition, people within the network can add metadata to each other's photos so giving added benefit to all.</p>\n<h3>Aggregation</h3>\n<p>Having multiple types of data for each item (date, tags, geolocation, 'interestingness') means you can display it in lots of different ways.</p>\n<h3>Open APIs</h3>\n<p>Start with a basic API (ie ready-only) and work up to a full-featured one. The advantage of APIs is that it allows others to build features for you that you have neither the resources or inclination to build yourself. In addition it forms a free marketing tool as people who use it will talk about it.</p>\n<p>A selfish reason for building an API is that it makes getting at your data easier so reducing the number of people grabbing your data by more invasive methods such as page-scraping.</p>\n<h3>Clean URLs</h3>\n<p>2 out of 2 for this one! Cal adds that once given a nice url, it should never be changed as it will have been bookmarked and linked to. Obvious but worth re-stating. He also mentions that as urls become cleaner more people will start to manipulate them, so Flickr for example shows the hierarchy of the information within the url. He goes on to say that it's worth making sure your urls will scale with the site.</p>\n<h3>AJAX</h3>\n<p>Not the first time this will be looked at today, this enables load on the server to be reduced (something which was raised later was that you might experience increased server load as your users interact more with the site - but that's all good!).</p>\n<h3>Unicode UTF-8</h3>\n<p>It's all about internationalisation and localisation, baby! Cal points out the difference between the two (enabling storage vs output in differnet language).</p>\n<h3>Desktop integration</h3>\n<p>Bringing the website out of the browser means your site has more reach and makes it easier for users to interact with it (dragging &amp; dropping files is one task which is far easier to accomplish on the desktop). Build widgets to allow uploading of files, plugging into the API. Allow email to be a delivery tool for publishing content.</p>\n<h3>Mobile</h3>\n<p>WAP really hasn't changed our lives, but many of the newer phones have browsers based on Opera. Cal's main point here is that it is a different type of user who is going to be using a mobile to view the site and so you should re-purpose your content to suit; swapping out the styles may no longer be enough.</p>\n<h3>Open Data</h3>\n<p>This is important stuff for service sites - allow your users to feel that they can leave with all their data at any time (and that includes any metadata which they may have added while using your service). All this can be accmplished via APIs allowing 3rd party sevices to add more value.</p>\n<h3>Open Content</h3>\n<p>Again important stuff. The data belongs to the user along with all the rights, unless specified by the user by Creative Commons or suchlike. The site cannot use or modiy the data without their permission.</p>\n\n    ",

His main thrust was that the web has the opportunity to move from isolated sites to a model based on interconnected services.</p>\n<p>Every service can be built upon existing services and this makes them all the more powerful. This all incorporates the use of APIs of course which has the effect of embedding your service within the community. An interesting point was that the combination of GoogleMaps and GoogleAds could enable everyone's favourite search engine to target their advertising geographically. This ties into <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html?page=1\">Tim O'Reilly's assertion</a> that the race is one to 'own' certain types of data - eg location, identity, calendaring of public events. It is these services which will form the basis of the web as a platform.</p>\n<p>He then went on to identify the 'Architectural Principles' of Web 2.0, citing Matt Biddulph's <a href=\"http://hackdiary.com/slides/xtech2005/\">'The Application of Weblike Design to Data'</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add value to the aggregate web of data.</li>\n<li>Build for normal users (consumers); developers (give them hooks to build on); machines (predictability).</li>\n<li>Start designing with data not pages.</li>\n<li>Identify your first order objects (eg tv programmes, people, events) and make them addressable. Give them a unique and well-structured url, a single page for services to reference so everyone knows they are talking about the same thing - means aggregation can be effective.</li>\n<li>Readable, reliable and hackable urls. Use directories to represent hierarchies (enables hackable urls) to reflect the structure of the data. They shouldn't reflect the underlying technology so use mod_rewrite or equivalent to clean them up (3 out of 3!). This goes most of the way towards making them as humanly readable as possible.</li>\n<li>Correlate with external identifier schemes - knowing what you are referring to and linking to other sources eg IMDB for movie information.</li>\n<li>Build list views and batch manipulation interfaces to go with the destination (first order) pages. These are the 3 core types of page. You can then use Ajax/Flash to manipulate the data within each type of page -only manipulate the concept within the page in question eg don't edit tags within a list page.</li>\n<li>Parallel data representation. Reuse the data in parallel to the original page eg RSS for the list page and XML for the destination page. Del.icio.us uses RSS really well. <a href=\"http://www.microformats.org/\">Microformats</a> can be used too.</li>\n<li>Make your data as discoverable as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n    ",

It is centred around 'convention over configuration' and the basic premise seems to be that most of the work done by web programmers is mundane and is repeated again and again - 'You are not a snowflake'. Shouldn't you then concentrate on what makes you unique in coding terms and let the framework do all the heavy lifting?</p>\n<p>To demonstrate this he shows us some code in Rails and proceeds to remove everything which confers some sort of pattern, from naming fields in tables to setting defaults. This leaves a much slimmed down code example. If we make the configuration the exception rather than the norm we can write slimmer, more beautiful code.</p>\n<p>Flexibility is overrated - it leads to more complex systems which are harder to modify; constraints are liberating and lead to consistent systems and happier teams.</p>\n<p>He then moves into Rails proper and demonstrates how it encourages good practice, for example by incorporating test pages into the cycle; &quot;You do know testing is good, don't you?&quot; Compare this to PHP (David developed in PHP for 5 years) where the devil on the other shoulder tends to get heard: &quot;You can test it at the end&quot;, &quot;No-one else needs to know how this algorithm works - it makes you a more valuable employee!&quot;.</p>\n\n    ",

      "value": "\n      <p>&quot;How to Build an Enterprise Web App on a Budget&quot;.</p>\n<p>This was a great talk and made my top spot on the feedback. No-one ever talks about this kind of detail in the frank was that Ryan did.</p>\n<h2>Why build?</h2>\n<p>You don't have to be big anymore. Web applications are much more acceptable to people than they were a few years ago. Combine this with the plummeting cost of hardware and availability of Open Source software and OS.</p>\n<h2>Enterprise</h2>\n<p>Ryan defines enterprise as mass market or 1,000+ users.</p>\n<h2>The Budget</h2>\n<p>He says that the minimum cost for an enterprise web app is £30,000. you should make sure that the idea is financially viable ie that it is worth paying for. use your common sense - would you pay for it? be cautious about your projections - get a pessimistic guess and then cut by 45%. Are you still in business? Then go ahead, oh, and make sure you plann for profit from the start.</p>\n<p>DropSend is a hardware intensive application so some of the following figures would need adjusting for other apps.</p>\n<table>\n    <caption>Breakdown of costs for DropSend</caption>\n\t\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost</th></tr>\n\t\t</thead>\n\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr><td>Branding and UI design</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Ryan Shelton Mutado.com £5,000</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Development</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Plum Digital Media £8,500 + equity</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Desktop Apps</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£2,750</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>XHTML/CSS</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£1,600</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Hardware</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Old Linux box for dev testing £500</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Hosting and maintenance</td>\n\t\t\t<td>5 Servers from BitPusher £800 pcm</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Legal</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£2,630</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Accounting</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£500</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Linux Specialist</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£500</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Misc</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£1,950</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Trademark</td>\n\t\t\t<td>£250</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Merchant Account</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Halifax £200</td></tr>\n\t\t<tr><td>Payment Processor</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Secure Trading £500</td></tr>\n\t\t</tbody>\n\t\t<tfoot>\n\t\t<tr><td>Total</td><td>£25,680</td></tr>\n\t\t</tfoot>\n\t</table>\n<p>And that only includes one month of hosting.</p>\n<p>To help with raising this capital Ryan ran a side business - Carson Workshops - but it still took a year to raise the necessary.</p>\n<h2>Building a team on a budget</h2>\n<p>Go for quiet talent rather than rock-stars. Big names cost and are generally busy busy.</p>\n<p>Offer a percentage of product equity (2-5%) which becomes bankable if the product is aquired.</p>\n<p>Ask for recommendations - getting the wrong person can be disasterous. or you can always outsource - Ryan tried India but it didn't work out for him, largely due to the distances involved.</p>\n<h2>Scalability</h2>\n<p>Buy just enough hardware to launch, but build your app so it easily scales - can you easily plug in disk space? Don't get tempted by lots of shiny new servers.</p>\n<p>Plan for scalability but don't obsess about it.</p>\n<h2>Keeping it cheap</h2>\n<p>Don't spend money unless you have to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>no stationary (DropSend wasted ٟ,000 on this!)</li>\n<li>no new shiny machines - they built DropSend on a aging beige pc.</li>\n<li>no luxuries</li>\n<li>no features beyond the bare minimum - don't be tempted to say &quot;what if we did this&quot;. You can add more features later, anything else is stopping you from launching and generating profit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you spend anything more than £25, just check yourself and make sure you really need it.</p>\n<p>Make deals. Build websites, give away equity, give advertising on your blog.</p>\n<p>Use IM, no phone calls.</p>\n<p>Do as much yourself as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wireframing</li>\n<li>marketing</li>\n<li>user testing</li>\n<li>bookkeeping</li>\n<li>copy writing</li>\n<li>get friends to help with user testing</li>\n<li>shop around - the first hosting quote ryan got was for £12,000 pcm!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pessimism</h2>\n<p>You will go 10% over budget and 3 months over schedule. Plan for it at the outset and put it in the cash flow. Are you still in business?</p>\n<h2>Lawyers</h2>\n<p>Make use of those free 1 hour consultations!</p>\n<p>Company terms of service will cost £1,000; contracts for freelancers £800; privacy policy (from Clickdocs) £15.</p>\n<h2>Cheap Software/hardware</h2>\n<p>DropSend was developed primarily with cheap/free software from start to finish.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project management - BaseCamp</li>\n<li>Bug Tracking - Trac</li>\n<li>Meetings - Skype and AIM</li>\n<li>Version Control - SubVersion</li>\n<li>LAMP</li>\n<li>£200 Linux box for testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Marketing</h2>\n<p>Don't spend money! Use blogs and word of mouth. Look for viral delivery tools - make your app tell other people about your app (eg DropSend sends email notifications and includes info on itself). Write about your app for the trade magazine of your target audience - they will generally be happy to accept it.</p>\n<h2>Venture Capital</h2>\n<p>You need a seriously good reason to give away some of your company to v.c.</p>\n\n    ",

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT has taken the world by storm and this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis&quot;&gt;OpenAI released the ChatGPT API&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve spent some time playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/chat&quot;&gt;ChatGPT in the browser&lt;/a&gt;, but the best way to really get on board with these new capabilities is to try building something with it. With the API available, now is that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haihai.ai/chatgpt-api/&quot;&gt;Greg Baugues&apos;s implementation of a chatbot command line interface (CLI) in 16 lines of Python&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&apos;d start by trying to build the same chatbot but using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(It turns out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.haihai.ai/chatgpt-api-js/&quot;&gt;Ricky Robinett also had this idea and published his bot code here&lt;/a&gt;, it&apos;s pleasing to see how similar the implementations are!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The code&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Node.js requires a bit more code to deal with command line input than Python, so where Greg&apos;s version was 16 lines mine takes 31. Having built this little bot, I&apos;m no less excited about the potential for building with this API though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s the full code, I&apos;ll explain what it is doing further down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { createInterface } from &quot;node:readline/promises&quot;;\nimport { stdin as input, stdout as output, env } from &quot;node:process&quot;;\nimport { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from &quot;openai&quot;;\n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY });\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\nconst readline = createInterface({ input, output });\n\nconst chatbotType = await readline.question(\n  &quot;What type of chatbot would you like to create? &quot;\n);\nconst messages = [{ role: &quot;system&quot;, content: chatbotType }];\nlet userInput = await readline.question(&quot;Say hello to your new assistant.\\n\\n&quot;);\n\nwhile (userInput !== &quot;.exit&quot;) {\n  messages.push({ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: userInput });\n  try {\n    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n      messages,\n      model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n    });\n\n    const botMessage = response.data.choices[0].message;\n    if (botMessage) {\n      messages.push(botMessage);\n      userInput = await readline.question(&quot;\\n&quot; + botMessage.content + &quot;\\n\\n&quot;);\n    } else {\n      userInput = await readline.question(&quot;\\nNo response, try asking again\\n&quot;);\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log(error.message);\n    userInput = await readline.question(&quot;\\nSomething went wrong, try asking again\\n&quot;);\n  }\n}\n\nreadline.close();\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you run this code it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-left&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/chatgpt/chatgpt.gif&quot; alt=&quot;An example of the chatbot running. I ask it to respond in haiku and it does twice.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s dig into how it works and how you can build your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Building a chatbot&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/overview&quot;&gt;OpenAI platform account&lt;/a&gt; to interact with the ChatGPT API. Once you have signed up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys&quot;&gt;create an API key&lt;/a&gt; from your account dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you have Node.js installed, the only other thing you&apos;ll need is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;openai&lt;/code&gt; Node.js module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start a Node.js project and create this CLI application. First create a directory for the project, change into it and initialise it with npm:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir chatgpt-cli\ncd chatgpt-cli\nnpm init --yes\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;openai&lt;/code&gt; module as a dependency:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install openai\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; and add the key &lt;code&gt;&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the configuration, so we can build this as an ES module which will allow us to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await&quot;&gt;top level await&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create a file called &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; and open it in your editor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Interacting with the OpenAI API&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to the code, dealing with input and output on the command line and dealing with the OpenAI API. Let&apos;s start by looking at how the API works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First we import two objects from the &lt;code&gt;openai&lt;/code&gt; module, the &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OpenAIApi&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt; class will be used to create a configuration that holds the API key, you can then use that configuration to create an &lt;code&gt;OpenAIApi&lt;/code&gt; client.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { env } from &quot;node:process&quot;;\nimport { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from &quot;openai&quot;;\n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY });\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, we&apos;ll store the API key in the environment and read it with &lt;code&gt;env.OPENAI_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To interact with the API we now use the OpenAI client to create chat completions for us. OpenAI&apos;s text generating models don&apos;t actually converse with you, but are built to take input and come up with plausible sounding text that would follow that input, &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/introduction&quot;&gt;a completion&lt;/a&gt;. With ChatGPT, &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction&quot;&gt;the model is configured to receive a list of messages and then come up with a completion for the conversation&lt;/a&gt;. Messages in this system can come from one of 3 different entities, the &quot;system&quot;, &quot;user&quot; and &quot;assistant&quot;. The &quot;assistant&quot; is ChatGPT itself, the &quot;user&quot; is the person interacting and the system allows the program (or the user, as we&apos;ll see in this example) to provide instructions that define how the assistant behaves. Changing the system prompts for how the assistant behaves is one of the most interesting things to play around with and allows you to create different types of assistants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;code&gt;openai&lt;/code&gt; object configured as above, we can create messages to send to an assistant and request a response like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const messages = [\n  { role: &quot;system&quot;, content: &quot;You are a helpful assistant&quot; },\n  { role: &quot;user&quot;, content: &quot;Can you suggest somewhere to eat in the centre of London?&quot; }\n];\nconst response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n  messages,\n  model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n});\nconsole.log(response.data.choices[0].message);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;Of course! London is known for its diverse and delicious food scene...&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the conversation goes on, we can add the user&apos;s questions and assistant&apos;s responses to the messages array, which we send with each request. That gives the bot history of the conversation, context for which it can build further answers on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To create the CLI, we just need to hook this up to user input in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Interacting with the terminal&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Node.js provides the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html&quot;&gt;Readline module&lt;/a&gt; which makes it easy to receive input and write output to streams. To work with the terminal, those streams will be &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can import &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;node:process&lt;/code&gt; module, renaming them to &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; to make them easier to use with Readline. We also import the &lt;code&gt;createInterface&lt;/code&gt; function from &lt;code&gt;node:readline&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { createInterface } from &quot;node:readline/promises&quot;;\nimport { stdin as input, stdout as output } from &quot;node:process&quot;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We then pass the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; streams to &lt;code&gt;createInterface&lt;/code&gt; and that gives us an object we can use to write to the output and read from the input, all with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#rlquestionquery-options&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const readline = createInterface({ input, output });\n\nconst chatbotType = await readline.question(\n  &quot;What type of chatbot would you like to create? &quot;\n);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The above code hooks up the input and output stream. The &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; object is then used to post the question to the output and return a promise. When the user replies by writing into the terminal and pressing return, the promise resolves with the text that the user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Completing the CLI&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With both of those parts, we can write all of the code. Create a new file called &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; and enter the code below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We start with the imports we described above:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { createInterface } from &quot;node:readline/promises&quot;;\nimport { stdin as input, stdout as output, env } from &quot;node:process&quot;;\nimport { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from &quot;openai&quot;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then we initialise the API client and the Readline module:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const configuration = new Configuration({ apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY });\nconst openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\nconst readline = createInterface({ input, output });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, we ask the first question of the user: &quot;What type of chatbot would you like to create?&quot;. We will use the answer of this to create a &quot;service&quot; message in a new array of messages that we will continue to add to as the conversation goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const chatbotType = await readline.question(\n  &quot;What type of chatbot would you like to create? &quot;\n);\nconst messages = [{ role: &quot;system&quot;, content: chatbotType }];\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We then prompt the user to start interacting with the chatbot and start a loop that says while the user input is not equal to the string &quot;.exit&quot; keep sending that input to the API. If the user enters &quot;.exit&quot; the program will end, like in the Node.js REPL.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let userInput = await readline.question(&quot;Say hello to your new assistant.\\n\\n&quot;);\n\nwhile (userInput !== &quot;.exit&quot;) {\n  // loop\n}\n\nreadline.close();\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the loop we add the &lt;code&gt;userInput&lt;/code&gt; to the messages array as a &quot;user&quot; message. Then, within a try/catch block, send it to the OpenAI API. We set the model as &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot; which is the underlying name for ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When we get a response from the API we get the message out of the &lt;code&gt;response.data.choices&lt;/code&gt; array. If there is a message we store it as an &quot;assistant&quot; message in the array of messages and output it to the user, waiting for their input again using readline. If there is no message in the response from the API, we alert the user and wait for further user input. Finally, if there is an error making a request to the API we catch the error, log the message and tell the user to try again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;while (userInput !== &quot;.exit&quot;) {\n  messages.push({ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: userInput });\n  try {\n    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n      messages,\n      model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n    });\n\n    const botMessage = response.data.choices[0].message;\n    if (botMessage) {\n      messages.push(botMessage);\n      userInput = await readline.question(&quot;\\n&quot; + botMessage.content + &quot;\\n\\n&quot;);\n    } else {\n      userInput = await readline.question(&quot;\\nNo response, try asking again\\n&quot;);\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log(error.message);\n    userInput = await readline.question(\n      &quot;\\nSomething went wrong, try asking again\\n&quot;\n    );\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Put that all together and you have your assistant. The full code is at the top of this post or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/asst/blob/basic-asst/index.js&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can now run the assistant by passing it your OpenAI API key as an environment on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY node index.js\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will start your interaction with the assistant, starting with it asking what kind of assistant you want. Once you&apos;ve declared that, you can start chatting with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Experimenting helps us to understand&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&apos;m not actually sure how useful ChatGPT is. It is clearly impressive, its ability to return text that reads as if it was written by a human is incredible. However, it returns content that is not necessarily correct, regardless of how confidently it presents that content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with ChatGPT is the only way that we can try to understand what it useful for, thus building a simple chat bot likes this gives us grounds for that experiment. Learning that the system commands can give the bot different personalities and make it respond in different ways is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might have heard, for example, that you can ask ChatGPT to help you with programming, but you could also specify a JSON structure and effectively use it as an API as well. But as you experiment with that you will likely find that it should not be an information API, but more likely something you can use to understand your natural text and turn it into a JSON object. To me this is exciting as it means that ChatGPT could help create more natural voice assistants, that can translate meaning from speech better than the existing crop that expect commands to be given in a more exact manner. I still have experimenting to do with this idea, and having this tool gives me that opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;This is just the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If experimenting with this technology is the important thing for us to understand what we can build with it and what we should or should not build with it, then making it easier to experiment is the next goal. My next goal is to expamnd this tool so that it can save, interact with and edit multiple assistants so that you can continue to work with them and improve them over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/asst/tree/basic-asst&quot;&gt;the full code for this first assistant in GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, follow the repo to keep up with improvements.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I recently came across this &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell&quot;&gt;blog post from Ruud van Asseldonk titled &quot;The yaml document from hell&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve always heard that yaml has its pitfalls, but hadn&apos;t looked into the details and thankfully hadn&apos;t been affected, mainly due to my very infrequent and simple use of yaml. If you are in the same boat as me, I recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell&quot;&gt;that article&lt;/a&gt; now as I almost can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve avoided any issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article digs into the issues in the yaml spec itself, and then describes what happens in Python&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/6.0/&quot;&gt;PyYAML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml&quot;&gt;Golang&apos;s yaml library&lt;/a&gt; with an example file, the titular yaml document from hell. I wanted to see how things were in the JavaScript ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Yaml in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A search for JavaScript yaml parsers on npm brings up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/&quot;&gt;yaml&lt;/a&gt; (which I have used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/ngrok-for-vscode&quot;&gt;my own project&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml&quot;&gt;js-yaml&lt;/a&gt;. js-yaml has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://npmtrends.com/js-yaml-vs-yaml&quot;&gt;most weekly downloads according to npm and the most stars on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; however yaml seems to be under more active development, having been most recently published (a month ago at the time of writing) compared to js-yaml&apos;s last publish date almost 2 years ago. There is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeremyfa/yaml.js&quot;&gt;yamljs&lt;/a&gt;, but the project hasn&apos;t received a commit since November 2019 and hasn&apos;t been released for 6 years, so I am going to disregard it for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s see what yaml and js-yaml do with the yaml document from hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The document itself&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To save yourself from going back and forth between &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell&quot;&gt;van Asseldonk&apos;s article&lt;/a&gt; and this one, here is the yaml document.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;server_config:\n  port_mapping:\n    # Expose only ssh and http to the public internet.\n    - 22:22\n    - 80:80\n    - 443:443\n\n  serve:\n    - /robots.txt\n    - /favicon.ico\n    - *.html\n    - *.png\n    - !.git  # Do not expose our Git repository to the entire world.\n\n  geoblock_regions:\n    # The legal team has not approved distribution in the Nordics yet.\n    - dk\n    - fi\n    - is\n    - no\n    - se\n\n  flush_cache:\n    on: [push, memory_pressure]\n    priority: background\n\n  allow_postgres_versions:\n    - 9.5.25\n    - 9.6.24\n    - 10.23\n    - 12.13\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So how do our JavaScript libraries handle this file?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The failures&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Anchors, aliases, and tags&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start with the failures. As described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell#anchors-aliases-and-tags&quot;&gt;the original article under the subhead &quot;Anchors, aliases, and tags&quot;&lt;/a&gt; this section is invalid:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  serve:\n    - /robots.txt\n    - /favicon.ico\n    - *.html\n    - *.png\n    - !.git  # Do not expose our Git repository to the entire world.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This causes both of our JavaScript yaml libraries to throw an error, both referencing an undefined alias. This is because the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is a way to reference an anchor created earlier in the document using an &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;. In our document&apos;s case, that anchor was never created, so this is a parsing error.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about anchors and aliases it seems like something that is important in build pipelines. Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/yaml-anchors/&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/yaml_optimization.html&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; have written about how to use anchors to avoid repeating sections in yaml files.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of trying to get the file to parse, we can make those aliases strings as they were likely intended.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  serve:\n    - /robots.txt\n    - /favicon.ico\n    - &quot;*.html&quot;\n    - &quot;*.png&quot;\n    - !.git  # Do not expose our Git repository to the entire world.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we get another parsing error from our libraries; both of them complain about an unknown or unresolved tag. The &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; at the start of &lt;code&gt;!.git&lt;/code&gt; is the character triggering this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tags seem to be the most complicated part of yaml to me. They depend on the parser you are using and allow that parser to do something custom with the content that follows the tag. My understanding is that you could use this in JavaScript to, say, tag some content to be parsed into a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; instead of an &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; instead of an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;. Van Asseldonk explains this with this alarming sentence:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;strong&gt;loading an untrusted yaml document is generally unsafe&lt;/strong&gt;, as it may lead to arbitrary code execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PyYaml apparently has a &lt;code&gt;safe_load&lt;/code&gt; method that will avoid this, but Go&apos;s yaml package doesn&apos;t. It seems that the JavaScript libraries also lack this feature, so the warning for untrusted yaml documents stands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you do want to take advantage of the tag feature in yaml, you can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eemeli.org/yaml/#custom-data-types&quot;&gt;yaml package&apos;s documentation on custom data types&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#supported-yaml-types&quot;&gt;js-yaml&apos;s supported yaml types&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml-js-types&quot;&gt;unsafe type extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To make the yaml file parse, let&apos;s encase all the weird yaml artifacts in quotes to make them strings:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  serve:\n    - /robots.txt\n    - /favicon.ico\n    - &quot;*.html&quot;\n    - &quot;*.png&quot;\n    - &quot;!.git&quot;  # Do not expose our Git repository to the entire world.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt; block looking it does above, the file now parses. So what happens to the rest of the potential yaml gotchas?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Accidental numbers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that I am gathering from this investigation so far is that if you need something to be a string, do not be ambiguous about it, surround it in quotes. That counted for the aliases and tags above and it also counts for accidental numbers. In the following section of the yaml file you see a list of version numbers:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  allow_postgres_versions:\n    - 9.5.25\n    - 9.6.24\n    - 10.23\n    - 12.13\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Version numbers are strings, numbers can&apos;t have more than one decimal point in them. But when this is parsed by either JavaScript library the result is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  allow_postgres_versions: [ &apos;9.5.25&apos;, &apos;9.6.24&apos;, 10.23, 12.13 ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have an array of strings and numbers. If a yaml parser thinks something looks like a number it will parse it as such. And when you come to use those values they might not act as you expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Version numbers in GitHub Actions&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have had this issue within GitHub Actions before. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L11&quot;&gt;in a Ruby project&lt;/a&gt;, but this applies to anyone trying to use version numbers in a GitHub Actions yaml file. I tried to use a list of Ruby version numbers, this worked fine up until Ruby version 3.1 was released. I had &lt;code&gt;3.0&lt;/code&gt; in the array. Within GitHub Actions this was parsed as the integer &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. This might seem fine, except that when you give an integer version to GitHub Actions it picks the latest minor point for that version. So, once Ruby 3.1 was released, the number &lt;code&gt;3.0&lt;/code&gt; would select version 3.1. I had to make the version number a string, &lt;code&gt;&quot;3.0&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and then it was applied correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Accidental numbers cause issues. If you need a string, make sure you provide a string.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The successes&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s not all bad in the JavaScript world. After working through the issues above, we might now be in the clear. Let&apos;s take a look now at what parsed correctly from this yaml file.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sexagesimal numbers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Under the port mapping section of the yaml file we see:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  port_mapping:\n    # Expose only ssh and http to the public internet.\n    - 22:22\n    - 80:80\n    - 443:443\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;22:22&lt;/code&gt; is dangerous in yaml version 1.1 and PyYaml parses it as a sexagesimal (base 60) number, giving the result of &lt;code&gt;1342&lt;/code&gt;. Thankfully both JavaScript libraries have implemented yaml 1.2 and &lt;code&gt;22:22&lt;/code&gt; is parsed correctly as a string in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  port_mapping: [ &apos;22:22&apos;, &apos;80:80&apos;, &apos;443:443&apos; ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Norway problem&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In yaml 1.1 &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt; is parsed as &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. This is known as &quot;the Norway problem&quot; because listing countries as two character identifiers is fairly common and having this yaml:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  geoblock_regions:\n    - dk\n    - fi\n    - is\n    - no\n    - se\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;parsed into this JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  geoblock_regions: [ &apos;dk&apos;, &apos;fi&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, false, &apos;se&apos; ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;is just not helpful. The good news is that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v3.0.1#compatibility&quot;&gt;unlike Go&apos;s yaml library&lt;/a&gt;, both JavaScript libraries have implemented yaml 1.2 and dropped &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt; as an alternative for &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;geoblock_regions&lt;/code&gt; sections is successfully parsed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  geoblock_regions: [ &apos;dk&apos;, &apos;fi&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;no&apos;, &apos;se&apos; ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Non-string keys&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might believe that keys in yaml would be parsed as strings, like JSON. However they can be any value. Once again there are values that may trip you up. Much like with the Norway problem in which &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt; can be parsed as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, the same goes for &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;. This is manifested in our yaml file in the &lt;code&gt;flush_cache&lt;/code&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  flush_cache:\n    on: [push, memory_pressure]\n    priority: background\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here the key is &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt;, but in some libraries it is parsed as a boolean. In Python, even more confusingly the boolean is then stringified and appears as the key &lt;code&gt;&quot;True&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Thankfully this is handled by the JavaScript libraries and &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; becomes the key &lt;code&gt;&quot;on&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  flush_cache: { on: [ &apos;push&apos;, &apos;memory_pressure&apos; ], priority: &apos;background&apos; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is of particular concern in GitHub Actions again, where &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; is used to determine what events should trigger an Action. I wonder if GitHub had to work around this when implementing their parsing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Parsing as yaml version 1.1&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many of the issues that our JavaScript libraries sidestep are problems from yaml 1.1 and both libraries have fully implemented yaml 1.2. If you do wish to throw caution to the wind, or you have to parse a yaml file explicitly with yaml 1.1 settings, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/&quot;&gt;yaml&lt;/a&gt; library can do that for you. You can pass a second argument to the &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; function to tell it to use version 1.1, like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { parse } from &quot;yaml&quot;;\nconst yaml = parse(yamlContents, { version: &quot;1.1&quot; });\nconsole.log(yaml);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you get a result with all of the fun described above:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{\n  server_config: {\n    port_mapping: [ 1342, &apos;80:80&apos;, &apos;443:443&apos; ],\n    serve: [ &apos;/robots.txt&apos;, &apos;/favicon.ico&apos;, &apos;*.html&apos;, &apos;*.png&apos;, &apos;!.git&apos; ],\n    geoblock_regions: [ &apos;dk&apos;, &apos;fi&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, false, &apos;se&apos; ],\n    flush_cache: { true: [ &apos;push&apos;, &apos;memory_pressure&apos; ], priority: &apos;background&apos; },\n    allow_postgres_versions: [ &apos;9.5.25&apos;, &apos;9.6.24&apos;, 10.23, 12.13 ]\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note that in this case I left the aliases and tags quoted as strings so that the file could be parsed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stick with version 1.2, the default in both JavaScript yaml libraries, and you&apos;ll get a much more sensible result.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Isn&apos;t yaml fun?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this post we&apos;ve seen that it&apos;s easy to write malformed yaml if you weren&apos;t aware of aliases or tags. It&apos;s also easy to write mixed arrays of strings and numbers. There are also languages and libraries in which yaml 1.1 is still hanging around and &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt; are booleans and some numbers can be parsed into base 60.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My advice, after going through all of this, is to err on the side of caution when writing yaml. If you want a key or a value to be a string, surround it in quotes and explicitly make it a string.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are parsing someone else&apos;s yaml then you will need to program defensively and try to handle the edge cases, like accidental numbers, that can still cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you have the option, choose a different format to yaml. Yaml is supposed to be human-friendly, but the surprises and the bugs that it can produce are certainly not developer-friendly and ultimately that defeats the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell#alternative-configuration-formats&quot;&gt;conclusion to the original yaml document from hell post suggests many alternatives to yaml&lt;/a&gt; that will work better. I can&apos;t help but think that in the world of JavaScript that something JSON based, but  friendlier to author, should be the solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a package that simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/strip-json-comments&quot;&gt;strips comments from JSON&lt;/a&gt; or there&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5&quot;&gt;JSON5&lt;/a&gt; a JSON format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand. JSON5 supports comments as well as trailing commas, multiline strings, and various number formats. Either of these are a good start if you want to make authoring JSON easier and parsing hand authored files more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you can avoid yaml, I recommend it. If you can&apos;t, good luck.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Two factor authentication (2FA) is a great way to improve the security of user accounts in an application. It helps protect against common issues with passwords, like users picking easily guessable passwords or reusing the same password across multiple sites. There are different ways to implement two factor authentication, including SMS, using an authenticator application and WebAuthn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SMS is the most widely used and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/sms-2fa-security&quot;&gt;won&apos;t be going away&lt;/a&gt;, so it falls on us as developers to do our best to build the best SMS 2FA experience for our users. The WebOTP API is one way we can help reduce friction in the login experience and even provide some protection against phishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What is the WebOTP API?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebOTP_API&quot;&gt;WebOTP API&lt;/a&gt; is an extension to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API&quot;&gt;Credential Management API&lt;/a&gt;. The Credential Management API started by giving us the ability to store and access credentials in a browser&apos;s password manager, but now encompasses &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API&quot;&gt;WebAuthn&lt;/a&gt; and two factor authentication. The WebOTP API allows us to request permission from the user to read a 2FA code out of an incoming SMS message.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you implement the WebOTP API the second step of a login process can go from an awkward process of reading and copying a number of digits from an SMS, to a single button press. A great improvement, I think you&apos;ll agree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/webotp/webotp.gif&quot; alt=&quot;An animation showing a login experience where after entering a username and password, a permissions dialog pops up asking for permission to read a 2FA code from an SMS. When approved, the code is entered into an input and the form submitted.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To implement WebOTP you will need to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Update the message you send with the WebOTP format&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add some JavaScript to the login page to request permission to read the message&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The SMS message&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To have the WebOTP API recognise a message as an incoming 2FA code you need to add a line to the end of the message that you send. That line must include an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; symbol followed by the domain for the site that your user will be logging in to, then a space, the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; symbol and then the code itself. If your user is logging in on &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; and the code you are sending them is &lt;code&gt;123456&lt;/code&gt; then the message needs to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your code to log in to the application is 123456&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;@example.com #123456&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The domain ties the message to the website the user should be logging onto. This helps protect against phishing, WebOTP can&apos;t be used to request the code from an SMS if the domain the user is logging in to doesn&apos;t match the domain in the message. Obviously it can&apos;t stop a user copying a code across from a message, but it might give them pause if they come to expect this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have your messages set up in the right format you need some JavaScript on your 2nd factor page that will trigger the WebOTP API, ask the user permission for access to the message and collect the code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most minimal version of this code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (&apos;OTPCredential&apos; in window) {\n  navigator.credentials.get({\n    otp: {\n      transport: [&apos;sms&apos;]\n    }\n  }).then((otp) =&amp;gt; {\n    submitOTP(otp.code);\n  });\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We ask the &lt;code&gt;navigator.credentials&lt;/code&gt; object to get a one time password (OTP) from the SMS transport. If the browser detects an incoming message with the right domain and a code in it, the user will be prompted, asking for access. If the user approves the promise resolves with an &lt;code&gt;otp&lt;/code&gt; object which has a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; property. You can then submit that code to the form and complete the user&apos;s login process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A more complete version of the code, that handles things like finding an input and form, cancelling the request if the form is submitted, and submitting the form if the request is successful, looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (&apos;OTPCredential&apos; in window) {\n  window.addEventListener(&apos;DOMContentLoaded&apos;, e =&amp;gt; {\n    const input = document.querySelector(&apos;input[autocomplete=&quot;one-time-code&quot;]&apos;);\n    if (!input) return;\n    const ac = new AbortController();\n    const form = input.closest(&apos;form&apos;);\n    if (form) {\n      form.addEventListener(&apos;submit&apos;, e =&amp;gt; ac.abort());\n    }\n    navigator.credentials.get({\n      otp: { transport:[&apos;sms&apos;] },\n      signal: ac.signal\n    }).then(otp =&amp;gt; {\n      input.value = otp.code;\n      if (form) {\n        form.submit();\n      }\n    }).catch(err =&amp;gt; {\n      console.error(err);\n    });\n  });\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will work for many sites, but copying and pasting code isn&apos;t the best way to share code, so I came up with something a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Declarative WebOTP with web components&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Safari, you can get similar behaviour to the WebOTP API by adding one attribute to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element for the OTP code. Setting &lt;code&gt;autocomplete=&quot;one-time-code&quot;&lt;/code&gt; will trigger Safari to offer the code from the SMS via autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this, I wanted to make WebOTP just as easy. So, I published a web component, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-otp-input&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-otp-input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component&lt;/a&gt;, that handles the entire process. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-otp-input&quot;&gt;all the code and how to use it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. For a quick example, you can add the component to your page as an ES module:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/@philnash/web-otp-input&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or install it to your project from npm:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install @philnash/web-otp-input\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and import it to your application:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { WebOTPInput } from &quot;@philnash/web-otp-input&quot;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can then wrap the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-otp-input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; around your existing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; within a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form action=&quot;/verification&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;label for=&quot;otp&quot;&amp;gt;Enter your code:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;web-otp-input&amp;gt;\n      &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; autocomplete=&quot;one-time-code&quot; inputmode=&quot;numeric&quot; id=&quot;otp&quot; name=&quot;otp&quot; /&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/web-otp-input&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&amp;gt;Submit&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then the WebOTP experience will happen automatically for anyone on a browser that supports it, without writing any additional JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;WebOTP: a better experience&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The WebOTP API makes two factor authentication with SMS a better experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_otpcredential&quot;&gt;For browsers that support it&lt;/a&gt;, entering the code that is sent as a second factor becomes a breeze for users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are even circumstances where it works for desktop browsers too. For a user with Chrome on the desktop and Chrome on Android and signed into their Google account on both, signing in on the desktop will cause a notification on the mobile device asking to approve sending the code to the desktop. Approving that on the mobile devices transfers the code to the desktop browser. You don&apos;t even have to write more code to handle this, all you need is the JavaScript in this article.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more on WebOTP, check out these articles:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/web-otp/&quot;&gt;Verify phone numbers on the web with the WebOTP API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/blog/cross-device-webotp/&quot;&gt;Verify a phone number on desktop using WebOTP API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are building two factor authentication or phone verification, consider implementing the WebOTP API as well to make that process easier for your users.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is different to most online services. It is a federated network, so when you set up an account you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/signup/&quot;&gt;choose a server to use&lt;/a&gt;. Your username then becomes a combination of your handle and that server you signed up to. For example, I am currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@philnash&quot;&gt;@philnash@mastodon.social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to personalise that a bit more? What if you wanted to use your own domain for your Mastodon account without having to host a whole Mastodon server? Using your own domain means that no matter what instance you used, or if you moved instance, you could share one Mastodon username that always pointed to the right profile and was personalised to your own site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;WebFinger to the rescue&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you can do this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2022/11/05/mastodon-own-donain-without-hosting-server.html&quot;&gt;Maarten Balliauw wrote about how Mastodon uses WebFinger to attach extra information to an email address&lt;/a&gt;. Information like an associated profile page or &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Implementing WebFinger requires your domain to respond to a request to &lt;code&gt;/.well-known/webfinger&lt;/code&gt; with a JSON representation of the associated accounts. If you have a Mastodon account you can check out what your WebFinger JSON looks like by making a request to &lt;code&gt;https://#{instance}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:#{username}@#{instance}&lt;/code&gt;. For example, my WebFinger JSON is available at this URL: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:philnash@mastodon.social&quot;&gt;https://mastodon.social/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:philnash@mastodon.social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To associate a Mastodon account with your own domain, you can serve this JSON yourself from a &lt;code&gt;/.well-known/webfinger&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;WebFinger with Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Maarten pointed out in his post, you can copy the JSON response from your Mastodon instance to a file that you then serve from your own site. My site is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, so I wanted to make it easy for me, and anyone else using Jekyll, to create and serve that WebFinger JSON. I&apos;ve also built Jekyll plugins before, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-gzip&quot;&gt;jekyll-gzip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-brotli&quot;&gt;jekyll-brotli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-zopfli&quot;&gt;jekyll-zopfli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-web_monetization&quot;&gt;jekyll-web_monetization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I got to work and built &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-mastodon_webfinger&quot;&gt;jekyll-mastodon_webfinger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;How to use it&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can serve up your own WebFinger JSON on your Jekyll site to point to your Mastodon profile by following these steps:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;jekyll-mastodon_webfinger&lt;/code&gt; to your Gemfile:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle add jekyll-mastodon_webfinger\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Add the plugin to your list of plugins in &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;plugins:\n  - jekyll/mastodon_webfinger\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Add your Mastodon username and instance to &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mastodon:\n  username: philnash\n  instance: mastodon.social\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next time you build the site, you will find a &lt;code&gt;/.well-known/webfinger&lt;/code&gt; file in your output directory, and when you deploy you will be able to refer to your Mastodon account using your own domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the result of this by checking the WebFinger endpoint on my domain: &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/.well-known/webfinger&quot;&gt;https://philna.sh/.well-known/webfinger&lt;/a&gt; or by searching for &lt;code&gt;@phil@philna.sh&lt;/code&gt; on your Mastodon instance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/mastodon/search.png&quot; alt=&quot;When you search for @phil@philna.sh on your Mastodon instance, you will find my account&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this is a static file it sort of acts like a catch-all email address. You can actually search for &lt;code&gt;@any_username@philna.sh&lt;/code&gt; and you will find me. If you wanted to restrict this, you would need to build an endpoint that could respond dynamically to the request.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Other ways to serve Mastodon WebFinger responses&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not the only one to have considered this. Along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2022/11/05/mastodon-own-donain-without-hosting-server.html&quot;&gt;Maarten&apos;s original post on the topic&lt;/a&gt;, others have built tools or posted about how to do this with your own site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Wardell wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lindsaykwardell.com/blog/integrate-mastodon-with-astro&quot;&gt;how to integrate Mastodon with Astro&lt;/a&gt; including showing how to display her feed within her Astro site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dominik Kundel put together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dkundel/netlify-plugin-mastodon-alias&quot;&gt;Netlify plugin that generates a Mastodon WebFinger&lt;/a&gt; file for your Netlify hosted site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Take a trip into the Fediverse&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An interesting side-effect of the increase in popularity of Mastodon is learning and understanding the protocols that underpin federating a social network like this. &lt;a href=&quot;http://webfinger.net/&quot;&gt;WebFinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; are having their moment and I look forward to see what further integrations and applications can be built on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can use the techniques in this post to use your own domain as an alias for your Mastodon profile. And if you fancy it, connect with me on Mastodon by searching for &lt;code&gt;@phil@philna.sh&lt;/code&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@philnash&quot;&gt;https://mastodon.social/@philnash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Link shortening has been around for a long time and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com/&quot;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; is arguably the king of the link shorteners. It has support for shortening long URLs as well as custom short links, custom domains, and metrics to track how each link is performing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those of us with the power of code at our fingertips, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/&quot;&gt;Bitly also has an API&lt;/a&gt;. With the Bitly API you can build all of the functionality of Bitly into your own applications and expose it to your users. In this post you&apos;ll learn how to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/bitly&quot;&gt;Bitly Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt; to use the Bitly API in your Ruby applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To start shortening or expanding links with the Bitly gem, you&apos;ll need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/&quot;&gt;Ruby installed&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com/pages/pricing&quot;&gt;Bitly account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To make API requests against the Bitly API you will need an access token. Log in to your Bitly account and head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.bitly.com/settings/api/&quot;&gt;API settings&lt;/a&gt;. Here you can enter your account password and generate a new token. This token will only be shown once, so copy it now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Using the Bitly API&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open a terminal and install the Bitly gem:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install bitly\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s explore the gem in the terminal. Open an &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; session:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Require the gem:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;bitly&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create an authenticated API client using the token you created in your Bitly account:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;client = Bitly::API::Client.new(\n  token: &quot;Enter your access token here&quot;\n)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Shortening a URL&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can now use this &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; object to access all the Bitly APIs. For example, you can shorten a URL to a Bitlink like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;long_url = &quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;\nbitlink = client.shorten(long_url: long_url)\nbitlink.link\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;https://bit.ly/3zYdN21&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference/#createBitlink&quot;&gt;shorten endpoint&lt;/a&gt; is a simplified method of shortening a URL. You can also use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference/#createBitlink&quot;&gt;create endpoint&lt;/a&gt; and set other attributes, like adding a title, tags or deeplinks into native applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;long_url = &quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;\nbitlink = client.create_bitlink(\n  long_url: long_url,\n  title: &quot;Phil Nash on Twitter&quot;,\n  tags: [&quot;social media&quot;, &quot;worth following&quot;]\n)\nbitlink.link\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;https://bit.ly/3zYdN21&quot;\nbitlink.title\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;Phil Nash on Twitter&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Expanding a URL&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The API client can also be used to expand Bitlinks. You can use the &lt;code&gt;expand&lt;/code&gt; method with any Bitlink, not just ones that you have shortened yourself. When you expand a URL you will get back publicly available information about the URL.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitlink = client.expand(bitlink: &quot;bit.ly/3zYdN21&quot;)\nbitlink.long_url\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;\nbitlink.title\n# =&amp;gt; nil\n# (title is not public information)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the URL was a Bitlink from your own account you get more detailed information when you use the &lt;code&gt;bitlink&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitlink = client.bitlink(bitlink: &quot;bit.ly/3zYdN21&quot;)\nbitlink.long_url\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;\nbitlink.title\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;Phil Nash on Twitter&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Other Bitlink methods&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have a &lt;code&gt;bitlink&lt;/code&gt; object, you can call other methods on it. If you wanted to update the information about the link, for example, you can use the &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bitlink.update(title: &quot;Phil Nash on Twitter. Go follow him&quot;)\nbitlink.title\n# =&amp;gt; &quot;Phil Nash on Twitter. Go follow him&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can also fetch metrics for your link, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference/#getClicksSummaryForBitlink&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clicks_summary&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference/#getClicksForBitlink&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;link_clicks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/api-reference/#getMetricsForBitlinkByCountries&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;click_metrics_by_country&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;click_summary = bitlink.clicks_summary\nclick_summary.total_clicks\n# =&amp;gt; 1\n# (not very popular yet)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Methods that return a list of metrics implement &lt;code&gt;Enumerable&lt;/code&gt; so you can loop through them using &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;country_clicks = bitlink.click_metrics_by_country\ncountry_clicks.each do |metric|\n  puts &quot;#{metric.value}: #{metric.clicks}&quot;\nend\n# =&amp;gt; AU: 1\n# (it was just me clicking it)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With these methods, you can create or fetch short links and then retrieve metrics about them. Your application can shorten links and measure their impact with a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;There&apos;s more!&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For advanced uses, you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/blob/main/docs/authentication.md&quot;&gt;authorise other Bitly accounts to create and fetch short links via OAuth2&lt;/a&gt; as well as manage your account&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/blob/main/docs/users.md&quot;&gt;users&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/blob/main/docs/groups.md&quot;&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/blob/main/docs/organizations.md&quot;&gt;organisations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A useful little tool&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To find out more about using the Bitly API with Ruby, you can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.bitly.com/&quot;&gt;Bitly API documentation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/bitly/&quot;&gt;Bitly gem&apos;s generated documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/tree/main/docs&quot;&gt;docs in the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, you can also read a bit more about the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/03/17/the-story-of-a-midly-popular-ruby-gem/&quot;&gt;backstory of the Bitly Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve been working on this project since 2009, would you believe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are you using the Bitly API or do you have any feedback or feature requests? Let me know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;Twitter at @philnash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/issues&quot;&gt;open an issue in the repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the platform we are building on provides more functionality than we can keep in our own heads. However, depending on the problem, we often find ourselves trying to write the code to solve the issue rather than finding and using the existing solution provided by the platform. I almost fell for this recently when trying to parse a query string.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I can do it myself&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A colleagues had a query string they needed to parse in a function, and asked for recommendations on how to do so. For some reason I decided to roll up my sleeves and code directly into Slack. I came up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function parse(input) {\n  return input\n    .split(&quot;&amp;amp;&quot;)\n    .map((pairs) =&amp;gt; pairs.split(&quot;=&quot;))\n    .reduce((acc, [k, v]) =&amp;gt; {\n      acc[k] = decodeURIComponent(v);\n      return acc;\n    }, {});\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty good, right? It even uses &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; which makes all array operations look extra fancy. And it works:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse(&quot;name=Phil&amp;amp;hello=world&quot;);\n// =&amp;gt; { name: &apos;Phil&apos;, hello: &apos;world&apos; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Except for when it doesn&apos;t work. Like if the query string uses the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; character to encode spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse(&quot;name=Phil+Nash&quot;);\n// =&amp;gt; { name: &apos;Phil+Nash&apos; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you have more than one value for a key, like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;parse(&quot;name=Phil&amp;amp;name=John&quot;)\n// =&amp;gt; { name: &quot;John&quot; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I could have worked to fix these issues, but that would just bring up more questions. Like how should multiple values be represented? Always as an array? On as an array if there is more than one value?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with all of this is that even after thinking about these extra issues, there are likely more hiding out there. All this thinking and coding is a waste anyway, because we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;URLSearchParams has a specification and several implementations&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/code&gt; class is specified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlsearchparams&quot;&gt;URL standard&lt;/a&gt; and started appearing in browsers in 2016 and in Node.js in 2017 (in version 7.5.0 as part of the &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; standard library module and then in version 10.0.0 in the global namespace).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It handles all of the parsing problems above:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const params = new URLSearchParams(&quot;name=Phil&amp;amp;hello=world&quot;);\nparams.get(&quot;name&quot;);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;Phil&quot;\nparams.get(&quot;hello&quot;);\n// =&amp;gt; world\n\nconst multiParams = new URLSearchParams(&quot;name=Phil&amp;amp;name=John&quot;);\nmultiParams.get(&quot;name&quot;);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;Phil&quot;\n// ???\nmultiParams.getAll(&quot;name&quot;);\n// =&amp;gt; [ &apos;Phil&apos;, &apos;John&apos; ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it handles more, like iterating over the parameters:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (const [key, value] of params) {\n  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`)\n}\n// =&amp;gt; name: Phil\n// =&amp;gt; hello: world\n\nfor (const [key, value] of multiParams) {\n  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`)\n}\n// =&amp;gt; name: Phil\n// =&amp;gt; name: John\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or adding to the parameters and serialising back to a query string:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiParams.append(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Terry&quot;);\nmultiParams.append(&quot;favouriteColour&quot;, &quot;red&quot;);\nmultiParams.toString();\n// =&amp;gt; &apos;name=Phil&amp;amp;name=John&amp;amp;name=Terry&amp;amp;favouriteColour=red&apos;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The final thing I like about &lt;code&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/code&gt; is that it is available in both the browser and Node.js. Node.js has had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;querystring&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt; since version 0.10.0, but when APIs like this are available on the client and server side, then JavaScript developers can be more productive regardless of the environment in which they are working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an aside, one of the things I appreciate about the Deno project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://deno.land/manual@v1.8.3/runtime/web_platform_apis&quot;&gt;their aim for Deno to use web platform APIs where possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Use the platform that is available&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post started as a story about choosing to write code to solve a problem that the platform already had solved. Once I realised my mistake I jumped straight back into Slack to correct myself and recommend &lt;code&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/code&gt;. When you understand the capabilities of the platform you are working with you can both code more efficiently and avoid bugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I never have to write code to parse URL parameters, I wrote this post to remind myself of that. You never have to either.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;When I am developing web applications in Node.js, I like the server to restart when I make changes, so I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodemon.io/&quot;&gt;nodemon&lt;/a&gt;. When I am developing an application that consumes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-webhook&quot;&gt;webhooks&lt;/a&gt; or that I want to share publicly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html&quot;&gt;I use ngrok&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I like ngrok so much, I volunteered to help maintain the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bubenshchykov/ngrok/&quot;&gt;Node.js wrapper for ngrok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you can run ngrok and nodemon separately and things work fine. But what if you always want to run them together and you want just one command to do that. Since nodemon is a Node package and ngrok has a Node wrapper, we can do this. Here&apos;s how.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;An example with a basic Express app&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might already have an application you want to do with this, but for the purposes of the post, let&apos;s create an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; application. We can create a basic application with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html&quot;&gt;Express generator&lt;/a&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx express-generator test-app\ncd test-app\nnpm install\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start the application with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open your browswer to &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt; and you will see the welcome page. You can also open &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000/users&lt;/code&gt; and it will say &quot;respond with a resource&quot;. Open &lt;code&gt;routes/users.js&lt;/code&gt; and change the route from:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;router.get(&apos;/&apos;, function(req, res, next) {\n  res.send(&apos;respond with a resource&apos;);\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;router.get(&apos;/&apos;, function(req, res, next) {\n  res.send(&apos;respond with a list of users&apos;);\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Refresh &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000/users&lt;/code&gt; and you will see it still returns &quot;respond with a resource&quot;. Stop the application, restart it with &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;, and when you reload the page it will have changed. We can make this better with nodemon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Starting the app with nodemon&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To start the application with nodemon, you first need to install the package:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install nodemon --save-dev\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can then run the application by opening &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; and changing the start script from &lt;code&gt;&quot;start&quot;: &quot;node ./bin/www&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&quot;start&quot;: &quot;nodemon ./bin/www&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. This works great and your application now restarts when you make changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Adding ngrok to the mix&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This all works great with nodemon on its own, but now we want to give the application a public URL while we are developing it. We can use ngrok for this and we can build it in using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bubenshchykov/ngrok&quot;&gt;ngrok Node package&lt;/a&gt;. Start by installing ngrok:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install ngrok --save-dev\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we could add ngrok to the &lt;code&gt;./bin/www&lt;/code&gt; script that the Express generator created for us. But if you do this, then every time you change something, nodemon will restart the application and your ngrok tunnel. If you&apos;re using a free or unregistered ngrok account then your ngrok URL will keep changing on every restart. Instead, let&apos;s build a script that starts an ngrok tunnel and then uses nodemon to run the application script &lt;code&gt;./bin/www&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create a new file in the &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; directoy called &lt;code&gt;./bin/dev&lt;/code&gt;. You might need to make this file executable with &lt;code&gt;chmod 755 ./bin/dev&lt;/code&gt;. Open it in your editor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start by adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)&quot;&gt;shebang&lt;/a&gt; for Node. We&apos;ll also add in a protection to make sure this script isn&apos;t run in production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === &quot;production&quot;) {\n  console.error(\n    &quot;Do not use nodemon in production, run bin/www directly instead.&quot;\n  );\n  process.exitCode = 1;\n  return;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, if the environment variable &lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/code&gt; is set to production the script will just return early.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, require the ngrok and nodemon packages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const ngrok = require(&quot;ngrok&quot;);\nconst nodemon = require(&quot;nodemon&quot;);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Use ngrok to open up a tunnel connecting to a port 3000 on localhost, the port that Express uses. To open the tunnel we call on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bubenshchykov/ngrok#connect&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt; method of ngrok&lt;/a&gt; which returns a promise that resolves with the URL of the ngrok tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngrok\n  .connect({\n    proto: &quot;http&quot;,\n    addr: &quot;3000&quot;,\n  })\n  .then(url =&amp;gt; {\n    console.log(url);\n  })\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can run this in the terminal with &lt;code&gt;./bin/dev&lt;/code&gt;, you will see an ngrok URL logged. So now we have started the ngrok tunnel, but we aren&apos;t yet running the Node application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s make the logging a bit nicer and then move on to starting the application with nodemon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngrok\n  .connect({\n    proto: &quot;http&quot;,\n    addr: &quot;3000&quot;,\n  })\n  .then(url =&amp;gt; {\n    console.log(`ngrok tunnel opened at: ${url}`);\n    console.log(&quot;Open the ngrok dashboard at: https://localhost:4040\\n&quot;);\n\n    nodemon({\n      script: &quot;./bin/www&quot;,\n      exec: `NGROK_URL=${url} node`,\n    });\n  })\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here we call on nodemon and pass two arguments via an object. The &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; is the file we want to run to start the application, in this case &lt;code&gt;./bin/www&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; option tells nodemon what script to execute to run the script. We set the &lt;code&gt;NGROK_URL&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to the URL that ngrok created for us so that we can refer to the ngrok URL within the application if we need it. Then the rest of the &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; command is &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start the application with &lt;code&gt;./bin/dev&lt;/code&gt; and you will see the application start up. You can load it at &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt; or at the ngrok URL that is logged. You will also find that if you change the response in &lt;code&gt;routes/users.js&lt;/code&gt; then it will update on the next refresh. Now you have ngrok and nodemon working together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Finessing the script&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is working now, but there are a couple more things we can do to improve the script. We can listen to events on nodemon to give us more information about what is happening to the application and when the underlying application quits, we should close the ngrok tunnel too. We should also catch any errors that might happen to ngrok when connecting a tunnel. Here&apos;s the full script:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === &quot;production&quot;) {\n  console.error(\n    &quot;Do not use nodemon in production, run bin/www directly instead.&quot;\n  );\n  process.exitCode = 1;\n  return;\n}\n\nconst ngrok = require(&quot;ngrok&quot;);\nconst nodemon = require(&quot;nodemon&quot;);\n\nngrok\n  .connect({\n    proto: &quot;http&quot;,\n    addr: &quot;3000&quot;,\n  })\n  .then((url) =&amp;gt; {\n    console.log(`ngrok tunnel opened at: ${url}`);\n    console.log(&quot;Open the ngrok dashboard at: https://localhost:4040\\n&quot;);\n\n    nodemon({\n      script: &quot;./bin/www&quot;,\n      exec: `NGROK_URL=${url} node`,\n    }).on(&quot;start&quot;, () =&amp;gt; {\n      console.log(&quot;The application has started&quot;);\n    }).on(&quot;restart&quot;, files =&amp;gt; {\n      console.group(&quot;Application restarted due to:&quot;)\n      files.forEach(file =&amp;gt; console.log(file));\n      console.groupEnd();\n    }).on(&quot;quit&quot;, () =&amp;gt; {\n      console.log(&quot;The application has quit, closing ngrok tunnel&quot;);\n      ngrok.kill().then(() =&amp;gt; process.exit(0));\n    });\n  })\n  .catch((error) =&amp;gt; {\n    console.error(&quot;Error opening ngrok tunnel: &quot;, error);\n    process.exitCode = 1;\n  });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Go back to &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; change the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; script back to &lt;code&gt;node ./bin/www&lt;/code&gt; and add a new script to run the application in dev mode:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node ./bin/www&quot;,\n    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;node ./bin/dev&quot;\n  },\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you can start your application with &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt; and it will use nodemon to restart on file changes and open an ngrok tunnel which doesn&apos;t change when the application restarts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/nodemon-ngrok-working-together.png&quot; alt=&apos;A terminal window showing the application running with both nodemon and ngrok. The logs show that some pages have been visited, then one of the routes changed and the app was reloaded.&apos; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Nodemon and ngrok working in tandem&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can adjust the script above to work for any of your applications. Indeed, aside from needing Node to run the nodemon and ngrok packages, you could use this for any application you are building. For more details, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon&quot;&gt;nodemon documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bubenshchykov/ngrok#ngrok&quot;&gt;ngrok documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are a VS Code user and you prefer having ngrok at the tip of your command prompt, take a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=philnash.ngrok-for-vscode&quot;&gt;ngrok for VS Code plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The script in this post was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/spalladino/45a6e54d7942ac0bad64dd54d7d12467&quot;&gt;Santiago Palladino&apos;s version&lt;/a&gt; which I brought up to date and added usage instructions.

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Time zones are hard. Not only are there a lot of them, but they don&apos;t fit nicely into whole hour blocks, daylight savings time changes individual zones some of the time, and zones move around and change all the time. In short, it is a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/time_zones.png&quot; alt=&quot;A map of time zones across the world&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png&quot;&amp;gt;Time zones of the world, via Wikimedia Commons&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, aren&apos;t they nice and easy?&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Events are happening online all the time and since people can join an online event from anywhere it is important to tell people what time that event will be happening for them. We need to combine an event&apos;s time, a user&apos;s time zone, and even their language and formatting preferences, to show a user a meaningful time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; API&lt;/a&gt;, the ECMAScript Internationalisation API, and specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which will aid us with date and time functions to achieve just that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Get a user&apos;s time zone in JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are two keys to getting a time correct in a user&apos;s time zone: the time in its original time zone and the user&apos;s time zone. If you have the time of an event, then it&apos;s up to you to provide that with its time zone, ideally in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601&quot;&gt;ISO 8601 format&lt;/a&gt;. But what can we do about getting the user&apos;s time zone?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; is an object that can help us format the time. It also comes with a utility that tells us more about the user&apos;s time. Running &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions()&lt;/code&gt; in a browser tells us everything the browser knows about the user&apos;s date and time preferences. If I run it for myself I get:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions();\n// =&amp;gt; {\n//   locale: &quot;en-AU&quot;,\n//   calendar: &quot;gregory&quot;,\n//   numberingSystem: &quot;latn&quot;,\n//   timeZone: &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot;,\n//   year: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n//   month: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\n//   day: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\n// };\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can see that the browser knows I am in the &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot; time zone. As I write this, that&apos;s Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT), UTC+11. Between some time in April and October it will be Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST), which is only UTC+10. See what I mean about this being hard? The place stays the same, but the time zone can change depending on the time of year. The good news is that &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; is aware of when that changes, so it can give us the time zone &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot; and internally know when that translates to AEDT or AEST.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have the time zone, we need to take a time and print it out for the time zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Showing a time in a time zone&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main job of &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; is to format a time for a user. It takes a language and then a bunch of options, including the time zone, and returns a formatter function. That function takes a datetime object as an argument and returns a string that you can display to the user.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can create a formatter that will format times for my time zone like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const formatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-AU&quot;, { timeZone: &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot; });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then I can use that formatter to print out a date. I&apos;ll use the date I am writing this as an example, that way I can just use &lt;code&gt;new Date()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const date = new Date();\nformatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;22/02/2021&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You don&apos;t actually need to provide a language or time zone to the formatter, it will pick the system defaults.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const minimalFormatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat();\nminimalFormatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;22/02/2021&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By default, the formatter outputs a short date form, even though the time is in there too. This is useful though, as we can still see that the time zone side of things is working. It may be the 22nd as I write this, but on the West coast of the USA it&apos;s still the 21st. We can see this by setting the time zone to something like &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const USFormatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-AU&quot;, { timeZone: &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; });\nUSFormatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;21/02/2021&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A day behind, as expected. Note that &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; takes a language string too. I&apos;ve been using Australian English as the setting, but we can set this to US English too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const reallyUSFormatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-US&quot;, { timeZone: &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; });\nreallyUSFormatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;02/21/2021&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we get the date in mm/dd/yyyy format, far and away &lt;em&gt;the worst format&lt;/em&gt;. But, since &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; knows international preferences for this, I can provide the language and the result will be formatted in the way the user expects and I never have to see a date with the month in the most significant place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an aside, there are a few ways to get a user&apos;s preferred language in the browser. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage/languages&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;navigator.languages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; returns an array of a user&apos;s preferred languages. &lt;code&gt;navigator.language&lt;/code&gt; is supposed to return the first element of &lt;code&gt;navigator.languages&lt;/code&gt;, but some browsers disagree and return the language of the browser UI, which is not necessarily the same. See more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_navigatorlanguage_languages&quot;&gt;the inconsistencies in this API on CanIUse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Formatting the time&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we know how to create a formatter that outputs a short date format, we need to know how to use it to format times the way we want. We saw that &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; takes a language and then an object of options, including &lt;code&gt;timeZone&lt;/code&gt;, to create a formatter. It is that object of options that we can use to add or remove parts of the date and time in the output. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat#parameters&quot;&gt;MDN has great documentation on the parameters for &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but let&apos;s take a quick look at some options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the examples above, we gave no input for how we wanted to format the date. This is the equivalent of passing the defaults we saw above in the response to &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{\n  day: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\n  month: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\n  year: &quot;numeric&quot;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;day&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; options can be set to &quot;numeric&quot; or &quot;2-digit&quot; and &lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt; can also be &quot;long&quot;, &quot;short&quot; or &quot;narrow&quot;. Let&apos;s see what happens if we change things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const newFormatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-AU&quot;, {\n  timeZone: &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot;,\n  month: &quot;long&quot;,\n  year: &quot;2-digit&quot;\n});\nnewFormatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;February 21&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this case I defined &lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; and left &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; off, so &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; no longer appears. Using &quot;2-digit&quot; for the &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt; changes the output from &quot;2021&quot; to &quot;21&quot; and using &quot;long&quot; for the &lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt; prints out the full name of the month, &quot;February&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can add other elements to this format too, like &lt;code&gt;weekday&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;era&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hour&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;minute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;timeZoneName&lt;/code&gt;. Here&apos;s a fully written out date time:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const fullFormatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-AU&quot;, {\n  timeZone: &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot;,\n  day: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  month: &quot;long&quot;,\n  year: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  weekday: &quot;long&quot;,\n  era: &quot;short&quot;,\n  hour: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  minute: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  second: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  timeZoneName: &quot;short&quot;\n});\nfullFormatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;Monday, 22 February 2021 AD, 5:05:52 pm AEDT&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of shortcuts you can use too; &lt;code&gt;timeStyle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dateStyle&lt;/code&gt; can be &quot;full&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; or &quot;short&quot; and you can use them together, but not with the above options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const shortcutFormatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-AU&quot;, {\n  timeZone: &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot;,\n  timeStyle: &quot;long&quot;,\n  dateStyle: &quot;short&quot;\n});\nshortcutFormatter.format(date);\n// =&amp;gt; &quot;22/2/21, 5:05:52 pm AEDT&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;When is your event?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, we can take all this knowledge and apply it to the date of an event. As I write this, it is the 22nd February, so let&apos;s consider an event in the future for me. Say it will occur on Friday 26th February, at 10am in the morning Pacific Time (UTC-8).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First we convert that time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-date-time-string-format&quot;&gt;ECMAScript compatible ISO 8601&lt;/a&gt; format: &lt;code&gt;2021-02-26T18:00:00.000Z&lt;/code&gt; (Z means UTC with no offset, so 10am Pacific Time is 6pm in UTC). Other formats are supported by browsers, but by convention only, not as part of the standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We take the date string and create a new &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; object with it. We also create a date formatter. We feed the date to the formatter and we get the date out in the correct time zone and format.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const excitingEventTime = &quot;2021-02-26T18:00:00.000Z&quot;;\nconst eventDate = new Date(excitingEventTime);\nconst formatter = Intl.DateTimeFormat(&quot;en-AU&quot;, {\n  timeZone: &quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot;,\n  day: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  month: &quot;long&quot;,\n  year: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  weekday: &quot;long&quot;,\n  hour: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  minute: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  second: &quot;numeric&quot;,\n  timeZoneName: &quot;short&quot;\n});\nformatter.format(eventDate);\n// =&amp;gt; Saturday, 27 February 2021, 5:00:00 am AEDT\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So there we go, Friday morning events in Pacific Time happen early Saturday morning in AEDT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Use Intl more&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; APIs, and in particular &lt;code&gt;Intl.DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt;, make it easier for us as developers to display datetimes in the format, the time zone and the language of our users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a bonus and because &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; is part of ECMAScript, it is also available in Node.js. You will want to be more careful with defaults when working on server though. The time zone, for example, is going to be where the server is located, not the time zone of your user. I recommend working in UTC on servers and using users&apos; time zones when displaying the datetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend you familiarise yourself with everything that is available under &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so you understand how you can use the platform to make your applications work better for your users wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/got&quot;&gt;Got is a Node.js library for making HTTP requests&lt;/a&gt;. It has both promise and stream based APIs and in this post I want to explore how to use the stream API to download files.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Using Got&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you use HTTP libraries for making API requests, then the promise method is likely the best for you. Making a basic HTTP request with Got looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const got = require(&quot;got&quot;);\n\ngot(url)\n  .then(response =&amp;gt; console.log(response.body))\n  .catch(error =&amp;gt; console.log(error.response.body));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The stream API gives us some extra benefits though. The promise API will load responses into memory until the response is finished before fulfilling the promise, but with the stream API you can act on chunks of the response as they arrive. This makes streams more memory efficient, particularly for large responses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Streaming a file download with Got&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can create a stream with Got using the &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; method or by setting &lt;code&gt;isStream&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in the options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;got.stream(url);\n// or\ngot(url, { isStream: true });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Got stream is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex&quot;&gt;duplex stream&lt;/a&gt;, which means it is both readable and writable. For the purposes of downloading a file, we will just be using its readable properties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To download a file we need to send the response to the file system somehow. Streams allow you to pipe the data from one stream to another. To write to the file system we can create a writable stream using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_createwritestream_path_options&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module&apos;s &lt;code&gt;createWriteStream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To test this out we&apos;ll need a file we can stream. The URL in the following examples is a 500KB gif that you might like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to use a Got stream and write the file to the file system looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const got = require(&quot;got&quot;);\nconst { createWriteStream } = require(&quot;fs&quot;);\n\nconst url =\n  &quot;https://media0.giphy.com/media/4SS0kfzRqfBf2/giphy.gif&quot;;\n\ngot.stream(url).pipe(createWriteStream(&apos;image.gif&apos;));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This code creates a Got stream of the image URL and pipes the data to a stream that writes the data into a file called &quot;image.jpg&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Handling progress and errors&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The above code will download the file as long as there are no problems. If an error occurs the code will crash with an unhandled exception. There is also no feedback, so if your file is large you will not see any result until the download is complete. We can listen to events on the stream to handle both of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start by rearranging the code above. We&apos;ll get individual handles to the Got stream and the file writer stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const got = require(&quot;got&quot;);\nconst { createWriteStream } = require(&quot;fs&quot;);\n\nconst url = &quot;https://media0.giphy.com/media/4SS0kfzRqfBf2/giphy.gif&quot;;\nconst fileName = &quot;image.gif&quot;;\n\nconst downloadStream = got.stream(url);\nconst fileWriterStream = createWriteStream(fileName);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, before we pipe the &lt;code&gt;downloadStream&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;fileWriterStream&lt;/code&gt; attach some event listeners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To get feedback on the progress of the download we can listen to the &lt;code&gt;downloadProgress&lt;/code&gt; event on the &lt;code&gt;downloadStream&lt;/code&gt;. The event fires with an object with 3 properties:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;transferred&lt;/code&gt;: the number of bytes transferred so far&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;: the total number of bytes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent&lt;/code&gt;: the proportion of the transfer that is complete (between 0 and 1)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the server you are downloading from doesn&apos;t return a &lt;code&gt;Content-Length&lt;/code&gt; header for the file, then &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; will be undefined and &lt;code&gt;percent&lt;/code&gt; will be 0 until the download is complete.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can handle errors on both the &lt;code&gt;downloadStream&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fileWriterStream&lt;/code&gt; by listening for the &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; event. It is good to handle both of these errors as it gives us information over what failed. If the &lt;code&gt;downloadStream&lt;/code&gt; emits an error then there is a problem with the URL, the network or the remote server. If the &lt;code&gt;fileWriterStream&lt;/code&gt; emits an error then there is a problem with the file system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For one last piece of feedback, we can also listen to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_event_finish&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; event&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;fileWriterStream&lt;/code&gt;. This event is fired once all data has been written to the file system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s complete the above code by adding these events and piping the &lt;code&gt;downloadStream&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;fileWriterStream&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const got = require(&quot;got&quot;);\nconst { createWriteStream } = require(&quot;fs&quot;);\n\nconst url = &quot;https://media0.giphy.com/media/4SS0kfzRqfBf2/giphy.gif&quot;;\nconst fileName = &quot;image.gif&quot;;\n\nconst downloadStream = got.stream(url);\nconst fileWriterStream = createWriteStream(fileName);\n\ndownloadStream\n  .on(&quot;downloadProgress&quot;, ({ transferred, total, percent }) =&amp;gt; {\n    const percentage = Math.round(percent * 100);\n    console.error(`progress: ${transferred}/${total} (${percentage}%)`);\n  })\n  .on(&quot;error&quot;, (error) =&amp;gt; {\n    console.error(`Download failed: ${error.message}`);\n  });\n\nfileWriterStream\n  .on(&quot;error&quot;, (error) =&amp;gt; {\n    console.error(`Could not write file to system: ${error.message}`);\n  })\n  .on(&quot;finish&quot;, () =&amp;gt; {\n    console.log(`File downloaded to ${fileName}`);\n  });\n\ndownloadStream.pipe(fileWriterStream);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you run the above code in a terminal you will see your download progress logged to the terminal and the image will be downloaded successfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/got-download.png&quot; alt=&quot;Running the code shows the download progress up to 100% then displays that the image has been downloaded.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/picture&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Getting fancy with more stream methods&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using streams to download files is more efficient than Got&apos;s promise methods, but the code above has taken a bit of a backward step in terms of developer experience. Rather than dealing with promises, which could be simplified with &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt;, we now have to handle events with calbacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can get back to this experience using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_pipeline_streams_callback&quot;&gt;Stream module &lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt; takes a number of streams as arguments and pipes the data between them. It also takes a callback function which is called if there is an error within the pipeline or once the pipeline is finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This still deals with callbacks, but we can use the Util module&apos;s &lt;code&gt;promisify&lt;/code&gt; function to turn it into a promise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Putting this together, we can simplify the above code to the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const got = require(&quot;got&quot;);\nconst { createWriteStream } = require(&quot;fs&quot;);\nconst stream = require(&quot;stream&quot;);\nconst { promisify } = require(&quot;util&quot;);\nconst pipeline = promisify(stream.pipeline);\n\nconst url = &quot;https://media0.giphy.com/media/4SS0kfzRqfBf2/giphy.gif&quot;;\nconst fileName = &quot;image.gif&quot;;\n\nconst downloadStream = got.stream(url);\nconst fileWriterStream = createWriteStream(fileName);\n\ndownloadStream.on(&quot;downloadProgress&quot;, ({ transferred, total, percent }) =&amp;gt; {\n  const percentage = Math.round(percent * 100);\n  console.error(`progress: ${transferred}/${total} (${percentage}%)`);\n});\n\npipeline(downloadStream, fileWriterStream)\n  .then(() =&amp;gt; console.log(`File downloaded to ${fileName}`))\n  .catch((error) =&amp;gt; console.error(`Something went wrong. ${error.message}`));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or adding in &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; for the final step:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(async () =&amp;gt; {\n  try {\n    await pipeline(downloadStream, fileWriterStream);\n    console.log(`File downloaded to ${fileName}`);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(`Something went wrong. ${error.message}`);\n  }\n})();\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Node streams are cool 😎&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Downloading a file is just one use of Node streams, you can find streams popping up all over the place. In this post we used a readable stream to download the file and a writable stream to write it to disk. You can also create readable streams of files and, if you are making &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests with Got, you can stream the upload of data too. Objects like &lt;code&gt;process.stdin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;process.stdout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;process.stderr&lt;/code&gt; are streams, as are HTTP &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse&quot;&gt;responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more on streams, check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream&quot;&gt;Node.js stream documentation&lt;/a&gt; and, for more in depth understanding, this guide on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/backpressuring-in-streams/&quot;&gt;backpressuring in streams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Over the Easter weekend, a four day weekend characterised by lockdowns all over the world, I decided to use the extra time I had at home to start a new project and learn a new skill. By the end of the weekend I was proud to release my first VSCode extension: &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=philnash.ngrok-for-vscode&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ngrok for VSCode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What&apos;s that now?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt; is a command line tool built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inconshreveable&quot;&gt;Alan Shreve&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to expose your localhost server with a publicly available URL. It&apos;s great for sharing access to an application running on your own machine, testing web applications on mobile devices or testing webhook integrations. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html&quot;&gt;I&apos;m a big fan of using ngrok to test my webhooks&lt;/a&gt; when I am working with Twilio applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt; is my current favourite text editor, built by Microsoft and based on JavaScript (well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/vscode&quot;&gt;mostly TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I was using VSCode last week I wondered if there was an extension that made it easier to use ngrok. I had a search and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WassimBenzarti/Ngrok-connect&quot;&gt;one under development&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ceyhunkeklik/vscode-ngrok-client&quot;&gt;that started a web server as well as running ngrok&lt;/a&gt;. So I decided to build the extension I wanted to see in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With version 1 of the extension you can start an ngrok tunnel with either a port number or by choosing one of your named tunnels from your &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/docs#config&quot;&gt;ngrok config file&lt;/a&gt;. There is one available setting, where you can set a custom path to a config file.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once a tunnel is running you can then open &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started-inspect&quot;&gt;the ngrok dashboard&lt;/a&gt; or close the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All the commands are available from the VSCode command palette.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s simple so far, but I wanted to keep the scope small and get it released.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/ngrok-for-vscode/start.png&quot; alt=&quot;An animation showing using the extension from the VSCode command palette.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The code is all open source and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/ngrok-for-vscode&quot;&gt;you can find it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What&apos;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would love for you to try the extension out, especially if you are already an ngrok user. If it&apos;s useful then I am looking for feedback, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/ngrok-for-vscode/issues&quot;&gt;bug reports and feature requests&lt;/a&gt; so I can continue to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One idea I have already is to provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#StatusBarItem&quot;&gt;Status Bar Item&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/tree-view&quot;&gt;Tree View&lt;/a&gt; that can give more information on and control over currently running ngrok tunnels. I should probably work out how to write tests for the extension too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What do you think?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really am after feedback, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=philnash.ngrok-for-vscode&quot;&gt;please install &lt;em&gt;ngrok for VSCode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=philnash.ngrok-for-vscode&amp;amp;ssr=false#review-details&quot;&gt;review on the VSCode Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/phil_nash/&quot;&gt;streaming live code on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; which is a lot of fun. I wanted to share on &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/&quot;&gt;my own site&lt;/a&gt; that I was streaming so I have built &lt;a href=&quot;/live/&quot;&gt;a page dedicated to it&lt;/a&gt;. The page will evolve, but one of the first things I wanted to include on it was an embed of my Twitch stream and chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twitch makes it easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed&quot;&gt;embed your stream&lt;/a&gt; but the less obvious part is how to make that embed responsive across any browser size. So here&apos;s how to create a responsive Twitch embedded stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The HTML&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are 3 ways you can embed Twitch on your site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/everything&quot;&gt;embedding everything&lt;/a&gt;, which involves loading the Twitch Embed JavaScript that creates an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/chat&quot;&gt;embedding just chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/video-and-clips&quot;&gt;embedding just video&lt;/a&gt;, both of which use simple &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s. Initially I thought I wanted to embed everything, but the video and chat within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; behaved weirdly and I didn&apos;t have any use for the interactive JavaScript library. Instead I plumped for embedding both the video and chat &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s which turned out gave me much more control over the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The HTML that I used looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;twitch&quot;&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;div class=&quot;twitch-video&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;iframe\n      src=&quot;https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=phil_nash&amp;amp;parent=philna.sh&amp;amp;autoplay=false&quot;\n      frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\n      scrolling=&quot;no&quot;\n      allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;\n      height=&quot;100%&quot;\n      width=&quot;100%&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;div class=&quot;twitch-chat&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;iframe\n      frameborder=&quot;0&quot;\n      scrolling=&quot;no&quot;\n      src=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/embed/phil_nash/chat?parent=philna.sh&quot;\n      height=&quot;100%&quot;\n      width=&quot;100%&quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The layout&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The video is in 16:9 aspect ratio. On mobile I want the chat to sit below the video and then when the screen becomes wide enough on the right hand side of the video. When side-by-side, the chat and video should be the same height.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The tricky part here is the aspect ratio. CSS doesn&apos;t have a native way to accomplish aspect ratios &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/aspect-ratio-unit-css/&quot;&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;. For now the way to force an aspect ratio in an element is unintuitive, but at least it works. You can apply this to any HTML you need to maintain a height that is relative to its width, things like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements, or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; embeds like YouTube or Twitch, as in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Aspect ratios with CSS&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The trick is to abuse how padding works on block elements. When you use percentage based top or bottom padding, that percentage is based on the width of the element. If we set the height of an element to 0, the width to 100% and the top padding to 75% then the element achieves an aspect ratio of 4:3. Change the padding to 56.25% and you have a 16:9 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I told you it was unintuitive. But it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that if we are just padding the top of the element then there is no actual space for the content. We solve this with absolute positioning, placing the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; back at the top of the element and giving it a height and width of 100% to fill out the space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the above HTML, the following CSS lays out the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a 16:9 aspect ratio:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.twitch .twitch-video {\n  padding-top: 56.25%;\n  position: relative;\n  height: 0;\n}\n\n.twitch .twitch-video iframe {\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  top: 0;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To complete the basic layout the chat &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; appears below the video and behaves as a regular block level element. I set a height to give the chat enough vertical space:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.twitch .twitch-chat {\n  height: 400px;\n}\n\n.twitch .twitch-chat iframe {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To create the side-by-side layout at wide screen sizes we need to alter this a bit. The video will take up 75% of the width of the container and the chat 25%. This is adjusted within a media query to only take effect above a certain width, for my site this became 850px.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When making the width of the video container 75%, you have to adjust the padding with the same ratio. To maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio the top padding becomes 42.1875%.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To keep the chat window the same height as the video, a little more absolute positioning is put into effect. The wrapper of both children is positioned relatively, then the chat &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is set to 25% width and placed absolutely on the right side of the wrapper:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@media screen and (min-width: 850px) {\n  .twitch {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n\n  .twitch .twitch-video {\n    width: 75%;\n    padding-top: 42.1875%;\n  }\n\n  .twitch .twitch-chat {\n    width: 25%;\n    height: auto;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 0;\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The result&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the above HTML and CSS, the output ends up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/twitch/twitches.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the wide view the video and chat are side by side, in the mobile view they are on top of one another.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Correct aspect ratios and responsive layout; mission accomplished. &lt;a href=&quot;/live/&quot;&gt;Check it out live here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this on your own site, feel free to take this HTML and CSS. Just remember to replace the channel name in the embed &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;. You can also learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/&quot;&gt;the CSS aspect ratio trick and other ways to accomplish the effect at CSS Tricks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/phil_nash&quot;&gt;please join me on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; where I will be chatting development, live coding a variety of projects, and generally having fun.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;The list on GitHub of repositories that depend on your repository is scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s something nice about writing and releasing a library, module, Ruby gem, whatever. It is code that you wrote that worked for you. There may be download numbers on the registry, but they are fairly abstract and don&apos;t necessarily relate to use. Seeing that there are real projects using the code that you wrote is kind of terrifying. More so when some of that code is still around from 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-left&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS05OTI5&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/bitly/dependents.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Bitly gem dependents page. Currently listed 639 repos and 20 packages.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The first days of the Bitly Ruby gem&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started out in the web development industry as a front-end developer. I joined a company that built sites in Ruby on Rails and eventually worked my way from working with views to controllers, then models, background jobs, mailers. The whole application stack. At that point I believed myself to be a Rails developer. I had never written any plain Ruby though. In an effort to change this, I decided I was going to write and release a gem.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it I liked working with APIs, was building a lot of social applications at work at the time and the era of Twitter&apos;s serious 140 characters and link shortening was upon us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitly.com/&quot;&gt;Bitly&lt;/a&gt; announced they were releasing a new API and I took this as a chance to write my first Ruby. I made my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/commit/8e8acfb2b45549f0baa879d4d6f214b5d928a314&quot;&gt;first commit to the GitHub repo on 21st January 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It appears that the first commit included enough code to shorten a URL with the API. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/commit/8e8acfb2b45549f0baa879d4d6f214b5d928a314#diff-0b3b8751a9471d9c3210979572e0bf28&quot;&gt;The tests were not good&lt;/a&gt;. Five days later it had grown into something I deemed worth releasing. On the 26th January 2009 I released version 0.1.0 into the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the 27th January 2009 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/commit/d8464c54d05cb352955fa00cad8a1800d736da93&quot;&gt;I released version 0.1.1&lt;/a&gt; because I&apos;d forgotten a dependency and version 0.1.0 just didn&apos;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notably these releases came before &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;Rubygems.org&lt;/a&gt; existed. (Remember those days? Me neither.) You cannot find these early releases available there, but that&apos;s probably for the best!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;It takes on a quiet life of its own&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The beauty of open source software is that when you put something out into the world and other people find it useful they will also contribute back. Over the course of 2009 I received contributions from 7 different developers improving and adding functionality to this code. In 2010 I released version 0.5.0 which had support for Bitly&apos;s version 3 API (no, I was not very good at semantic versioning back then).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the next 8 years, the gem didn&apos;t need a lot more work. I guess it just worked for its users. There were some feature additions and bug fixes from those that used it. In total, over the life of the project so far, there have been 17 contributors other than me. The project has never been perfect, it was my first after all, but it did the job for plenty of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Your code is not you&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;...but it&apos;s hard to remember that at times. The Bitly project has long been my most starred project on GitHub, it sits at the top of my pinned repositories on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/&quot;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt; and has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/profiles/philnash&quot;&gt;highest number of downloads on rubygems.org&lt;/a&gt; of my own projects. I&apos;m proud of it, but up until recently there was still code in that project from 2009. It always niggled at the back of my mind that, even though the gem worked, it wasn&apos;t a good representation of my ability to code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For this reason I embarked on a rewrite of the gem from the ground up in 2018. It was hard to motivate myself to complete it though, in fact I didn&apos;t get much beyond the OAuth2 implementation. It turns out that replacing working code is not a good reason to rewrite things, even if you don&apos;t like the existing code. In my head I was torn between rebuilding this project with the experience of 10 more years writing Ruby against using my time for other things that were important to me. Mostly my time won out, but it didn&apos;t stop me thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then in 2019 Bitly introduced the 4th version of the API. While that meant the rewrite pivoted from re-implementing the version 3 API, it still didn&apos;t drive motivation. Further, Bitly announced they would be stopping support for the version 3 API on the 1st March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually that got me going and I managed to put the work in to put together what has just been released as &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/bitly/versions/2.0.0&quot;&gt;version 2 of the Bitly Ruby gem&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m happier with the library I have put together this time, it is better written, better tested and better documented than ever before. It is once more a project I can be proud of and I hope that many more projects can happily integrate it for their link shortening requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The open source iceberg&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are many differences between a Ruby project like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/bitly&quot;&gt;Bitly gem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/rails&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/devise&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. So many open source projects are driven by a single maintainer and rely on their time and attention. They aren&apos;t core to applications, but they make developers&apos; lives easier. There&apos;s a lot of talk in the open source world about how to sustain the large projects that I think ignores the mildly popular projects. Much of that talk about sustainability focuses on making open source easier for under-represented developers to get into, open source shouldn&apos;t be the bastion of those with enough time and money to dedicate some of it to work on projects like this. But there are considerably more small projects than the flagship libraries and frameworks that can attract funding and those projects will continue to be built by those with expendable time and effort. I don&apos;t have any answers here, I just wanted to draw a little attention to the many, many open source projects in this position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I have more code to write&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I feel very fortunate to be able to find time to work on projects that allow me to practice my craft and potentially make another developer&apos;s life easier. The Bitly gem was my first foray into the world of creating an open source project and it lives on today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.bitly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004395631-Migrating-from-v3-to-v4-of-the-Bitly-API&quot;&gt;Bitly have removed their support for the version 3 API&lt;/a&gt; so there should be plenty of developers looking to upgrade their implementations or the libraries they depend on. Hopefully version 2 will suit them, maybe there will be more work in this gem for me yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The list on GitHub of repositories that depend on your repository is scary.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Some things you do as a developer can work for you for years, then turn around and bite you when you were least expecting. These are the things that you wish another developer had told you early in your career so you never had to make the mistakes. This post is about one of those things and if you&apos;re reading this, consider it me telling you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;File paths look like strings. You have a number of directories and maybe a file name with an extension at the end. You separate the directories and files with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; character and the result looks like &lt;code&gt;/path/to/file&lt;/code&gt;. So you can treat them like strings, joining them or concatenating them until you pass them to another file method that is used to read from or write to the file. These were my thoughts from just a few months ago. Here&apos;s where I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Don&apos;t forget Windows&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you develop on a Mac, like I have the privilege of doing, or Linux then you might have read the above paragraph and not noticed anything wrong. If develop on Windows you probably sighed into your cup of coffee as you read the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s all too easy to forget when you work with a Mac and deploy to Linux environments, like I have done for years, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/181774/why-windows-uses-backslashes-and-everything-else-uses-forward-slashes/&quot;&gt;Windows uses backslashes&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s all too painful to find out you&apos;ve made that mistake when you work on a command line tool that needs to run on both types of platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twilio-labs/create-twilio-function&quot;&gt;create-twilio-function&lt;/a&gt; is one such command line tool that had to go through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twilio-labs/create-twilio-function/commit/af3031dcd5947a2abb735f7769bcd8fdb7e1aa73&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twilio-labs/create-twilio-function/commit/fa281c1fce15db0915a8b403c4d19b9b2422da99&quot;&gt;of changes&lt;/a&gt; from things like:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir(path + &apos;/&apos; + dirName);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const path = require(&apos;path&apos;);\nmkdir(path.join(pathName, dirName));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;so that it would work properly on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To Windows users, I&apos;m sorry. To everyone else, when working with Node.js the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/path.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt; is your friend. Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_join_paths&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path.join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whenever you have to join two paths. And check out other utilities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_relative_from_to&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path.relative&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which returns a relative path from one path to another, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_normalize_path&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path.normalize&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which returns a path resolving segments like &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pay no attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_sep&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;path.sep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which returns a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt; depending on the system you&apos;re working on, just use &lt;code&gt;path.join&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Paths behave differently to strings&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To my second mistake, this time working in Ruby. This one was slightly more subtle and evaded my tests. You see, you can use the &lt;code&gt;Pathname&lt;/code&gt; class to create fragments of paths and then concatenate them. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;pathname&quot;\npath1 = Pathname.new(&quot;path&quot;)\npath2 = Pathname.new(&quot;to&quot;)\npath1 + path2\n# =&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Pathname:path/to&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see &lt;code&gt;Pathname&lt;/code&gt; objects have a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator that concatenates the paths, much like &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; concatenates strings. In fact, it also works with a mix of strings and paths:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;pathname&quot;\npath1 = Pathname.new(&quot;path&quot;)\npath2 = &quot;to&quot;\npath1 + path2\n# =&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Pathname:path/to&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This all seems well and good, except it doesn&apos;t work the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;pathname&quot;\npath1 = &quot;to&quot;\npath2 = Pathname.new(&quot;path&quot;)\npath1 + path2\n# =&amp;gt; TypeError (no implicit conversion of Pathname into String)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A nice error like that means we&apos;ve done something wrong, that was not the problem I had though. No, the issue I had stemmed from expecting to concatenate a pathname and a string and instead concatenating two strings. This manifested itself in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-gzip/&quot;&gt;my Rubygem &lt;code&gt;jekyll-gzip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You see, I was trying to create a glob of paths with the line:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;files = Dir.glob(dir + &quot;**/*{#{extensions}}&quot;)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out under some circumstances &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; was actually a string instead of a pathname and it didn&apos;t include a separator. So the glob was looking for &lt;code&gt;&quot;dirname**/*{#{extensions}}&quot;&lt;/code&gt; when I really wanted it to look for &lt;code&gt;&quot;dirname/**/*{#{extensions}}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Concatenating two pathnames or a pathname and a string will add the separator (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-gzip/commit/6651b7f51b62cd14a3e256d77fa604a49eacb9d8#diff-392aaa6a279f62e98df890fff8d82d1eL54-R54&quot;&gt;as someone pointed out in a comment on my commit&lt;/a&gt;), but concatenating two strings will not. This meant that the gem happily went looking for the wrong pathname, found no files and then proceeded to successfully do nothing. Replacing the entire line with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;files = Dir.glob(File.join(dir, &quot;**&quot;, &quot;*{#{extensions}}&quot;))\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;fixed the issue. In this case &lt;a href=&quot;https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.2/File.html#method-c-join&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the method to use to avoid surprises with strings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Always use the built in path tools&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&apos;re working in Node.js, Ruby, or any other language do not be tempted to treat file paths as strings. They behave differently on different platforms and mixing paths and strings together can cause hard to debug errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Use your standard library and save yourself the hassle.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;So you&apos;ve decided to speak at a developer conference? You have a story you want to share with your peers—how you built something, how you learned something new, how you became a better developer and how everyone else can too—but you need to find a stage on which to share this story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of developer conferences out there, covering everything you could think of in our industry. Knowing they are there is nice, but finding out which are coming up and are have an open call for proposals (CFP) is the challenge. Over a number of years of submitting to many and &lt;a href=&quot;/speaking&quot;&gt;getting accepted to a few conferences&lt;/a&gt;, I have researched a number of resources for finding CFPs and I want to share the current crop in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Websites, mailing lists, Twitter accounts&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally all CFPs that were relevant to your interests or communities would be sent directly to you. Sadly that&apos;s not how the world works. Instead, we are fortunate that a number of people and communities do the hard work to go out and find the available CFPs and aggregate them for us. The following list includes websites, mailing lists and Twitter accounts that share developer conferences and their CFPs. Mailing lists bring the CFPs to your inbox, Twitter accounts are great if you&apos;re all over social media and the sites are always worth browsing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read on to discover how to find developer conference CFPs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/cfpland.png&quot; alt=&quot;CFP Land&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;57&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the most comprehensive website and mailing list full of developer CFPs that I know today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfpland.com/conferences/&quot;&gt;CFP Land has a great list of conference CFPs&lt;/a&gt; that you can filter by category, region, date and whether they offer hotel, travel or a stipend for speakers. CFP Land also sends out a round up of CFPs weekly and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfpland.com/&quot;&gt;sign up for the mailing list on the CFP Land home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a bonus it also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cfp_land&quot;&gt;a Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feeds.cfpland.com/v2/rss/cfps&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; and even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfpland.github.io/api-docs/&quot;&gt;CFP API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing to consider is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pro.cfpland.com/&quot;&gt;CFP Land offers a professional account&lt;/a&gt;. The basic website and the other services listed above list CFPs that are closing within 21 days. The professional account gives you earlier access to the CFPs seen on the public site as well as tools to save CFPs you&apos;re interested in and reminders for when the deadlines are approaching. While I am not currently a customer and I can&apos;t comment on how much more useful this is, it is something I have considered and mostly I appreciate the effort to make CFP Land sustainable for the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/techdailycfp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tech Daily CFP&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;137&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tech Daily CFP is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/techdailycfp&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; that retweets developer CFPs and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://techdailycfp.com&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; that gathers those retweets and mails a collection of them once a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It can be quite intense to receive emails once a day with CFPs, but it definitely feels like you&apos;re not missing out on anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/papercall.png&quot; alt=&quot;PaperCall&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;81&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.papercall.io/&quot;&gt;PaperCall&lt;/a&gt; is a site on which you can host your conference&apos;s CFP, so naturally it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.papercall.io/events&quot;&gt;list of currently open CFPs&lt;/a&gt; that is always worth perusing. PaperCall used to run the very comprehensive WeeklyCFP mailing list, but I haven&apos;t heard from it for a while so I believe it&apos;s defunct (which is certainly a reason to support CFP Land&apos;s professional accounts).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/confstech.png&quot; alt=&quot;Confs.tech&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://confs.tech/&quot;&gt;Confs.tech&lt;/a&gt; is a community sourced list of conferences. They also &lt;a href=&quot;https://confs.tech/cfp&quot;&gt;list live CFPs&lt;/a&gt; that you can filter by category and country. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ConfsTech&quot;&gt;tweet out all the new conferences added to the site&lt;/a&gt; and I just discovered you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://confs.tech/&quot;&gt;sign up to their mailing list on their home page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/seecfp.png&quot; alt=&quot;SeeCFP&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;101&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I came across SeeCFP on the day of writing this post, so I&apos;m not very well acquainted with it yet. It has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/shrBMFY4CSpSRGmAs&quot;&gt;list of CFPs stored in Airtable&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://seecfp.com/&quot;&gt;weekly mailing list you can sign up to on the home page&lt;/a&gt;. They also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/appcfp&quot;&gt;tweet out CFPs that are close to their deadlines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/colloq.png&quot; alt=&quot;Colloq&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;105&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://colloq.io/&quot;&gt;Colloq&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a list of CFPs, it&apos;s a social event platform. It lists loads of events, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://colloq.io/events?callforpapers=open&quot;&gt;events with open CFPs&lt;/a&gt; but also lets you publicly say you are attending, links to ticket sales and collects coverage of the event after it happens (check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://colloq.io/events/accessibility-club/2019/berlin/1&quot;&gt;Accessibility Club Summit 2019&lt;/a&gt; for a good example of an event on Colloq).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Colloq is also a good example of an application that has been built with privacy and security at its heart (if only I could say that about more applications). Just read their &lt;a href=&quot;https://colloq.io/blog/how-our-password-check-works&quot;&gt;blog post on how they keep user passwords secure&lt;/a&gt; to see the level of attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/cfps/tulula.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tulula&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;122&quot; height=&quot;45&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tulu.la/&quot;&gt;Tulula&lt;/a&gt; lists events, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tulu.la/call-for-papers/&quot;&gt;particularly those with open CFPs&lt;/a&gt; and has a comprehensive filtering system to find the events that are important to you. It also includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.tulu.la/&quot;&gt;a forum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tulu.la/slack/&quot;&gt;Slack community&lt;/a&gt; so that you can meet and chat with others trying to improve their public speaking too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Other lists of conferences&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch more sites or Twitter accounts that are less comprehensive or that I don&apos;t necessarily use but came across as part of my research. Some are specific to languages or regions and any of them might be useful to browse once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyconferences.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby Conferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-tech-front-end-ux-conferences/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&apos;s upcoming web design conferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://conferences.css-tricks.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Tricks&apos; front-end design and development conferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://callingallpapers.com/&quot;&gt;CallingAllPapers&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/callingallpaper&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Readify/DevEvents&quot;&gt;Dev Events in Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cfp-organizer.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;CFP Organizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benmvp/frontend-confs&quot;&gt;Frontend Conferences for Speaking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://joind.in/event&quot;&gt;Joindin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/phpcfps&quot;&gt;PHP CFPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/moztechcfps&quot;&gt;Mozilla Tech CFPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finding the right conference for your talk is a challenge and hopefully these resources can help you to discover a few more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I&apos;ve missed a CFP resource, please let me know &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next up, watch out for my new mailing list sharing sites that list CFPs 😉.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Recently I&apos;ve been refactoring the tests for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twilio/authy-devise&quot;&gt;a gem I maintain&lt;/a&gt; and I needed to test that it sets the right cookies at the right time. But the cookies in use in the gem are signed cookies and that caused a slight hiccup for me. I&apos;d never tested the value in a signed cookie before and it wasn&apos;t immediately obvious what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would share what I found out in case it helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Cookies on Rails&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Rails applications there are three flavours of cookies available: simple session cookies, signed cookies and encrypted cookies. You can set any of these by using the &lt;code&gt;cookies&lt;/code&gt; object in a controller, like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CookiesController &amp;lt;  ApplicationController\n  def index\n    cookies[&quot;simple&quot;] = &quot;Hello, I am easy to read.&quot;\n    cookies.signed[&quot;protected&quot;] = &quot;Hello, I can be read, but I can&apos;t be tampered with.&quot;\n    cookies.encrypted[&quot;private&quot;] = &quot;Hello, I can&apos;t be read or tampered with.&quot;\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Simple cookies&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Simple cookies are made up of plain text. If you inspected the cookie above called &quot;simple&quot; in the browser you would see the text &quot;Hello, I am easy to read.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Simple cookies are ok for storing data that doesn&apos;t really matter. The end user can read and change it and your application shouldn&apos;t be affected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Signed cookies&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Signed cookies are not sent to the browser as plain text. Instead they comprise of a payload and signature separated by two dashes &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;. Before the dashes, the payload is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64&quot;&gt;base 64 encoded data&lt;/a&gt;. To read the data you can base 64 decode it. This data isn&apos;t secret, but it can&apos;t be tampered with because the second part of the cookie is a signature. The signature is created by taking an HMAC SHA1 digest of the application&apos;s &lt;code&gt;secret_key_base&lt;/code&gt; and the data in the cookie. If the contents of the cookie are changed when you try to read the cookie, the signature will no longer match the contents and Rails will return &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. Under the hood this is all handled by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.2.1/classes/ActiveSupport/MessageVerifier.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see above, you don&apos;t need to worry about that, you can treat the &lt;code&gt;cookies.signed&lt;/code&gt; object as if it were a hash.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Signed cookies are useful for data that can be read by the user, but you need to trust is the same when you get it back to the server again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Encrypted cookies&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Encrypted cookies take this one step further and encrypt the data in the cookie, then sign it. This is handled by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.2.1/classes/ActiveSupport/MessageEncryptor.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and means that without the &lt;code&gt;secret_key_base&lt;/code&gt; you cannot read or write to this cookie. Thankfully there&apos;s no need to worry about the encryption yourself, using the &lt;code&gt;cookies.encrypted&lt;/code&gt; object you can set encrypted cookies as though they were a regular hash.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Encrypted cookies are useful for private data that you want to store with the user, but you don&apos;t want them, or anyone, to read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Testing cookies&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Suppose we now want to test the controller we saw above. We want to ensure that all of our cookies are set correctly. The test might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CookiesControllerTest &amp;lt; ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest\n  test &quot;should set cookies when getting the index&quot; do\n    get root_url\n    assert_response :success\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I am easy to read.&quot;, cookies[&quot;simple&quot;]\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I can be read, but I can&apos;t be tampered with.&quot;, cookies[&quot;protected&quot;]\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I can&apos;t be read or tampered with.&quot;, cookies[&quot;private&quot;]\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or with RSpec Rails:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RSpec.describe CookiesController, type: :request do\n  it &quot;should set cookies when getting the index&quot; do\n    get root_url\n    expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)\n    expect(cookies[&quot;simple&quot;]).to eq(&quot;Hello, I am easy to read.&quot;)\n    expect(cookies[&quot;protected&quot;]).to eq(&quot;Hello, I can be read, but I can&apos;t be tampered with.&quot;)\n    expect(cookies[&quot;private&quot;]).to eq(&quot;Hello, I can&apos;t be read or tampered with.&quot;)\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But this would fail at the test for the signed cookie and wouldn&apos;t pass for the encrypted cookie either. You can&apos;t just call on those cookies straight out of the jar if they have been signed or encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might think you should test against the &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;encrypted&lt;/code&gt; version of the cookies, like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I can be read, but I can&apos;t be tampered with.&quot;, cookies.signed[&quot;protected&quot;]\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I can&apos;t be read or tampered with.&quot;, cookies.encrypted[&quot;private&quot;]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&apos;t work either. At least it doesn&apos;t work if you are using the currently recommended way of testing controllers, with &lt;code&gt;ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest&lt;/code&gt; in Minitest or &lt;code&gt;type: :request&lt;/code&gt; in RSpec.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have the older style &lt;code&gt;ActionController::TestCase&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;type: :controller&lt;/code&gt; tests, then &lt;code&gt;cookies.signed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cookies.encrypted&lt;/code&gt; will work. If you have an application with the older style tests, do carry on reading just in case you decide to refactor them to come in line with the current Rails way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the tests above, the &lt;code&gt;cookies&lt;/code&gt; object is actually an instance of &lt;code&gt;Rack::Test::CookieJar&lt;/code&gt;, which does not have knowledge of your Rails application secrets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;So how do we test these cookies?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is where I got to with the gem I was working on. I needed to test the result of a signed cookie, but I had a &lt;code&gt;Rack::Test::CookieJar&lt;/code&gt; object. The good news is we can bring the Rails application&apos;s own &lt;code&gt;ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar&lt;/code&gt; back into play to decode your signed cookies and decrypt your encrypted cookies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To do so, you instantiate an instance of &lt;code&gt;ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object from the test and a hash of your cookie data. You can then call &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;encrypted&lt;/code&gt; on that cookie jar. So now the test looks like:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class CookiesControllerTest &amp;lt; ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest\n  test &quot;should set cookies when getting the index&quot; do\n    get root_url\n    assert_response :success\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I am easy to read.&quot;, cookies[&quot;simple&quot;]\n    jar = ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar.build(request, cookies.to_hash)\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I can be read, but I can&apos;t be tampered with.&quot;, jar.signed[&quot;protected&quot;]\n    assert_equal &quot;Hello, I can&apos;t be read or tampered with.&quot;, jar.encrypted[&quot;private&quot;]\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or the spec would look like:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RSpec.describe CookiesController, type: :request do\n  it &quot;gets cookies from the response&quot; do\n    get root_url\n    expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)\n    expect(cookies[&quot;simple&quot;]).to eq(&quot;Hello, I am easy to read.&quot;)\n    jar = ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar.build(request, cookies.to_hash)\n    expect(jar.signed[&quot;protected&quot;]).to eq(&quot;Hello, I can be read, but I can&apos;t be tampered with.&quot;)\n    expect(jar.encrypted[&quot;private&quot;]).to eq(&quot;Hello, I can&apos;t be read or tampered with.&quot;)\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Red, Green, Re-snack-tor&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this post we&apos;ve seen how to test signed or encrypted cookies in Rails. Hopefully your test suite is running green and your cookies are covered now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m going to get back to the refactor I was working on. There are plenty more tests to cover now that these cookies have been polished off.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "How not to sort an array in JavaScript"
    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Array sorting is one of those things you don&apos;t spend too long thinking about, until it stops working for you. Recently I was working with array of items in JavaScript that were not sorting at all properly and completely messing up an interface. It took me way too long to work out what went wrong so I wanted to share what happened and why it was so weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Basic sorting&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has a &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; method available on Array objects and running it will probably do what you expect. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const stringArray = [&apos;cat&apos;, &apos;dog&apos;, &apos;ant&apos;, &apos;butterfly&apos;];\nstringArray.sort();\n// =&amp;gt; [ &apos;ant&apos;, &apos;butterfly&apos;, &apos;cat&apos;, &apos;dog&apos; ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s even pretty good if you&apos;re sorting arrays that might have members that are &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort&quot;&gt;MDN says that &quot;all undefined elements are sorted to the end of the array.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const stringArrayWithUndefined = [\n  &apos;cat&apos;,\n  undefined,\n  &apos;dog&apos;,\n  undefined,\n  &apos;ant&apos;,\n  &apos;butterfly&apos;,\n  &apos;zebra&apos;\n];\nstringArrayWithUndefined.sort();\n// =&amp;gt; [ &apos;ant&apos;, &apos;butterfly&apos;, &apos;cat&apos;, &apos;dog&apos;, &apos;zebra&apos;, undefined, undefined ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Gotchas&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first issue you might come across is if you find yourself with an array containing &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const stringArrayWithUndefinedAndNull = [\n  &apos;cat&apos;,\n  undefined,\n  &apos;dog&apos;,\n  undefined,\n  &apos;ant&apos;,\n  null,\n  &apos;butterfly&apos;,\n  &apos;zebra&apos;\n];\nstringArrayWithUndefinedAndNull.sort();\n// =&amp;gt; [ &apos;ant&apos;, &apos;butterfly&apos;, &apos;cat&apos;, &apos;dog&apos;, null, &apos;zebra&apos;, undefined, undefined ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sorting will coerce the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; to the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;null&quot;&lt;/code&gt; which will appear somewhere in the middle of the alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then there are numbers. The default JavaScript sorting algorithm is to convert all members of an array to strings and then compare their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values. This works great for arrays of strings as we&apos;ve already seen, but it breaks down very quickly for numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const numberArray = [5, 3, 7, 1];\nnumberArray.sort();\n// =&amp;gt; [ 1, 3, 5, 7 ]\n\nconst biggerNumberArray = [5, 3, 10, 7, 1];\nbiggerNumberArray.sort();\n// =&amp;gt; [ 1, 10, 3, 5, 7 ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the example above, 10 gets sorted to before 3 because &quot;10&quot; is sorted before &quot;3&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can fix this by providing JavaScript a comparison function to use to perform the sort. The function receives two items from the array and it needs to return a numeric value and whether that value is above, below or equal to zero defines how the items are sorted relative to each other. If the return value is less than zero, then the first item is sorted in front of the second, if the value is above zero then the second item is sorted in front of the first. If the return value is 0 then the items stay in the same order with respect to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To sort numbers in ascending order, the comparison function is relatively simple:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const compareNumbers = (a, b) =&amp;gt; a - b;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Subtracting the first item from the second one satisfies the requirements above. Using this comparison function with our &lt;code&gt;biggerNumberArray&lt;/code&gt; from earlier will sort the numbers correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;biggerNumberArray.sort(compareNumbers);\n// =&amp;gt; [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This still works if you have &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; elements as they are ignored and sorted to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const numberArrayWithUndefined = [5, undefined, 3, 10, 7, 1];\nnumberArrayWithUndefined.sort(compareNumbers);\n// =&amp;gt; [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, undefined ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; causes problems again though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const numberArrayWithUndefinedAndNull = [5, undefined, 3, null, 10, 7, 1];\nnumberArrayWithUndefinedAndNull.sort(compareNumbers);\n// =&amp;gt; [ null, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, undefined ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This happens because coercing &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; to a number returns 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Number(null);\n// =&amp;gt; 0\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You could handle this in your &lt;code&gt;compareNumbers&lt;/code&gt; function or be happy that it is consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Inconsistent gotchas&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem, and this caught me out recently, comes when &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; sneaks in another way. As we&apos;ve seen, if the array contains &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; it&apos;s ignored and just sorted to the back. However, if you are sorting objects where the keys may be &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; this automatic sorting doesn&apos;t happen and the results become inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have an array of objects where some of them have values and some don&apos;t, trying to sort by that value will not give you the result you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const objectArray = [\n  { value: 1 },\n  { value: 10 },\n  {},\n  { value: 5 },\n  { value: 7 },\n  { value: 3 }\n];\nconst compareObjects = (a, b) =&amp;gt; a.value - b.value;\nobjectArray.sort(compareObjects);\n// =&amp;gt; [ { value: 1 },\n//      { value: 10 },\n//      {},\n//      { value: 3 },\n//      { value: 5 },\n//      { value: 7 } ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Subtracting a number from &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; or subtracting &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; from a number both return &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; and since that doesn&apos;t lay on the scale of numbers that &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; needs from the comparison function the results end up a little strange. In this case, the item that caused the problem stays where it started in the array and the other objects are locally sorted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways around this, but the important thing is knowing that it can happen. In my case when I came across this, I filtered out the items that didn&apos;t have a value as they weren&apos;t important until they did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;objectArray\n  .filter(obj =&amp;gt; typeof obj.value !== &apos;undefined&apos;)\n  .sort(compareObjects);\n// =&amp;gt; [ { value: 1 },\n//      { value: 3 },\n//      { value: 5 },\n//      { value: 7 },\n//      { value: 10 } ]\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Beware sorting&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all of this is that the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; function is not as straightforward as it might seem. Strings work, numbers need some input and while &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; is handled as a primitive you have to keep an eye on coercing &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; object values.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have you come across problems sorting in JavaScript or other languages? I&apos;d love to hear your stories too, so give me a shout on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;Twitter at @philnash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I write blog posts to remind myself what I&apos;ve learned and sometimes I write them because someone else shares something and I want to remember that better. This post is one of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Starting a Node.js project&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Usually when I start a new Node.js project I use &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; to generate my initial project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; then asks me some questions and builds a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file for me. Then I start building the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Later I inevitably copy and paste a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file from GitHub&apos;s useful repo of &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; templates. And if I remember I&apos;ll actually create a &lt;code&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; file with the open source license that I intended to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then this week I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitandbang&quot;&gt;Tierney Cyren&lt;/a&gt; tweet this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;How to start any new Node.js project:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;$ npx license mit &amp;gt; LICENSE&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;$ npx gitignore node&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;$ npx covgen YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;$ npm init -y&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;You&apos;re ready to start coding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;— Tierney Cyren (@bitandbang) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitandbang/status/1082331715471925250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;January 7, 2019&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These four commands do everything that I was doing manually and more, setting up a project for success right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx license mit&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/license&quot;&gt;license package&lt;/a&gt; to download a license of choice, in this case the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx gitignore node&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitignore&quot;&gt;gitignore package&lt;/a&gt; to automatically download the relevant &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/gitignore&quot;&gt;GitHub&apos;s repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx covgen&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/covgen&quot;&gt;covgen package&lt;/a&gt; to generate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.contributor-covenant.org/&quot;&gt;Contributor Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and give your project a code of conduct that will be welcoming to all contributors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&apos;ve not seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before it looks locally to see if there is a command to run and executes it, if there is no local command it will try to download, install the command from &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, and run it. This is really useful when generating new projects and saves you from globally installing a bunch of &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; packages that are only used in this setup mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt; accepts all of the default options that &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt; asks you about&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tierney also suggested customising your &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt; defaults so that the output of &lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt; is correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Customising &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can see your current &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; config by entering &lt;code&gt;npm config list&lt;/code&gt; on the command line. To just see the config that affects &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt; you can &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; for &quot;init&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm config list | grep init\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a number of defaults you can set; author name, author email, author url, the license, and the version. To set them, you can enter them on the command line or use &lt;code&gt;npm config edit&lt;/code&gt; to open up the config file in your text editor. The command line is easy enough though, you can set all five defaults like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm set init.author.name &quot;Your name&quot;\nnpm set init.author.email &quot;your@email.com&quot;\nnpm set init.author.url &quot;https://your-url.com&quot;\nnpm set init.license &quot;MIT&quot;\nnpm set init.version &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have that customised to your liking, &lt;code&gt;npm init -y&lt;/code&gt; will always produce the right settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Building your own init script&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are some improvements that I&apos;d make to Tierney&apos;s commands, though I appreciate they were constrained by Twitter. Here&apos;s a bash script I have come up with inspired by their tweet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function node-project {\n  git init\n  npx license $(npm get init.license) -o &quot;$(npm get init.author.name)&quot; &amp;gt; LICENSE\n  npx gitignore node\n  npx covgen &quot;$(npm get init.author.email)&quot;\n  npm init -y\n  git add -A\n  git commit -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To the original I&apos;ve added fetching the license type, the author name and email from the &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt; defaults. I&apos;ve also initialised a new git repository and committed the results of this script as the &quot;Initial commit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can take this function and add it to your &lt;code&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;. Then, either &lt;code&gt;source ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; or open a new command line window and run &lt;code&gt;node-project&lt;/code&gt;. Feel free to add or remove other bits as you see fit to create your perfect initialisation script.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Go start a project&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you have the perfect script to start a Node.js project why not go create a new one? I have a few small projects in mind that I plan to build this year and this is a nice basis to start from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any more suggestions to improve the script, let me know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter at @philnash&lt;/a&gt;. Happy open sourcing!&lt;/p&gt;"

    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve never been one for writing a review of my year. This year I&apos;ve found myself not only reading, but comparing myself to others&apos; reviews. I realised that this is not particularly helpful, so decided I&apos;d give myself something to compare myself to at the end of 2019. Thus, here is my first year in review.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things I was proud of this year:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Professional&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;July 2018 saw me cross 4 years of working as a developer evangelist for &lt;a href=&quot;http://twilio.com/&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s been a really fun, interesting, hard, tiring and compelling role over this time. I&apos;m almost half way through my 5th year now and I&apos;m having a great time sharing my development experiences, helping other developers and being a part of the Twilio community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash?tab=overview&amp;amp;from=2018-12-01&amp;amp;to=2018-12-31&quot;&gt;GitHub tells me I made 582 contributions in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Those contributions were a good mix of personal projects, example Twilio applications and contributions to other open source projects. They also resulted in the release of 5 libraries; 4 in Ruby and one in JavaScript. They were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/pwned&quot;&gt;pwned&lt;/a&gt;: a library to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/03/better-passwords-in-ruby-applications-pwned-passwords-api.html&quot;&gt;access the Pwned Passwords API with Ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Three Ruby libraries for compressing text files in Jekyll sites:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-gzip&quot;&gt;jekyll-gzip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-zopfli&quot;&gt;jekyll-zopfli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-brotli/&quot;&gt;jekyll-brotli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-share-wrapper&quot;&gt;web-share-wrapper&lt;/a&gt;: a web component &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/blog/2018/04/25/web-share-api-with-web-components/&quot;&gt;to replace share links with the web share API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also began work to resurrect my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/bitly/&quot;&gt;RubyGem for the Bitly API&lt;/a&gt; as it has fallen way out of date. I need to spend more time with this though, the going has been slow so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At work I took over maintenance of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twilio/authy-devise&quot;&gt;Authy-Devise library&lt;/a&gt;. The library makes it easy to implement two factor authentication in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plataformatec/devise&quot;&gt;Devise&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy&quot;&gt;Twilio&apos;s Authy API&lt;/a&gt;. There&apos;s some good opportunities to improve the library this year, especially in testing. There are some interesting issues with testing a library that plugs in to a library that relies on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Helping&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like to help out &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/28376/philnash?tab=profile&quot;&gt;on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 2018 my reputation was 37,030 which I am incredibly proud of. In 2018 I left 345 answers, of which 169 were accepted. I also left 918 comments on questions/answers either asking for more information or following up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate enough to do this as part of my work, as it can take up quite a bit of time. Most of my answers are for questions tagged &quot;Twilio&quot; though you&apos;d be surprised by the variety of problems developers have within the bounds of including Twilio in an application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Learning&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In &quot;exceptionally late to the party&quot; news I managed to take some time in 2018 to start learning both React and Angular. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of applications that just work in the front-end (unless absolutely necessary, you can&apos;t host a WebRTC video chat without JavaScript!) and frameworks have tended to encourage that. This has changed over time and frankly both React and Angular are too big to ignore any more (and arguably were well before 2018 too).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve enjoyed kicking up my learning and there&apos;s going to be more of this, likely around React, for 2019. Look out for more blog posts as I discover new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my writing this year. Before 2018 I wrote the last post on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/07/12/two-tests-you-should-run-against-your-ruby-project-now/&quot;&gt;July 2017&lt;/a&gt;. I intended to be more consistent in my writing in 2018 and that sort of worked for the first 3/4 of the year. My last posts on both my blog and the Twilio blog were both in October. Still, the results aren&apos;t all bad. I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;9 posts on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot;&gt;philna.sh/blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;11 posts for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/pnash/&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 guest post for &lt;a href=&quot;https://rollbar.com/blog/top-10-ruby-on-rails-errors/&quot;&gt;Rollbar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;21 posts in total is good, but I want to improve on that this year. More consistency is the main aim again. Thankfully I have a number of drafts and projects already lined up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/speaking/history/&quot;&gt;I spoke 12 times in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. This is a marked step down from 2017 and even further from 2016. This coincides with my move to Australia where there are fewer events and fewer nearby countries to pop over to give talks, something I was fortunate enough to do in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, speaking is more about quality than quantity. I was lucky to be selected to speak at these wonderful conferences:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2018.jsconf.eu/speakers/&quot;&gt;JSConf EU&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webdirections.org/code/speakers/phil-nash.php&quot;&gt;Web Directions Code&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ndcsydney.com/talk/service-workers-beyond-the-cache/&quot;&gt;NDC Sydney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Voxxed Days Melbourne&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.angularconf.com.au/#speakers&quot;&gt;Angular Conf Australia&lt;/a&gt; (learning Angular this year paid off!)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gdgmelbourne.com/devfest-2018/&quot;&gt;Melbourne DevFest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;JSConf EU was certainly my highlight here, I&apos;ve been trying for years to get a talk accepted and I was elated when I received the confirmation email. The talk was one of the more important ones I&apos;ve given too, addressing developers&apos; use of push notifications and permissions on the web. It might also be the best talk title I&apos;ve ever come up with. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo-UOvq3-0Y&quot;&gt;&quot;Aggressive Web Apps&quot; on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun also presenting at local meetups. 2018 included talks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://melbjs.com/&quot;&gt;MelbJS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/the-web/&quot;&gt;The Web Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Melbourne/&quot;&gt;RoRo Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/&quot;&gt;RoRo Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I visited Sydney, Brisbane, Hobart, Singapore, Phuket, Bali, London, Berlin, New York, San Diego and San Francisco. 11 different places and 6 countries (aside from Australia).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I certainly racked up some miles there. I enjoy travelling, it&apos;s both part of the job and how I like to holiday. It can be tiring, particularly when it is for work, but with enough recovery time built in this much travel is sustainable. Getting to travel back to Europe for JSConf EU and use that as an opportunity to call in on my friends and family in the UK was fantastic too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to exploring more new parts of the world in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Personal&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2018 was my first full year living in Australia. It&apos;s been a fantastic year, Melbourne is an amazing city full of great food, interesting beer, lot&apos;s to do and above all welcoming and friendly people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kellydunlop&quot;&gt;Kelly&lt;/a&gt; and I liked it so much we bought a house here this year! This, combined with getting my permanent residency, means that we&apos;re going to be enjoying life in Melbourne for a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;In numbers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To summarise the above, here&apos;s what it looks like in numbers:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;🏠 1 new house&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n🛂 1 permanent residency&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n☎️ 4 years at Twilio&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n📝 21 blog posts&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n🎙 12 talks given&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n💻 582 GitHub contributions&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n💎 5 new libraries released&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n🏙 11 cities visited&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n🌏 6 countries visited&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n🍻 &lt;a href=&quot;https://untappd.com/user/philnash/beers&quot;&gt;296 new beers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you had a great 2018 and wish you all the best for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "Service workers: beware Safari's range request"
    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve implemented a service worker to cache some assets. Everything is working well, your service worker is a success, you&apos;re feeling good. But then...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some time passes and you deploy a video to your site. Everything is still working well in Chrome, in Firefox, in Edge. You check Safari. The video is broken. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That was me last month. I published an article on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/09/27/techniques-for-animating-on-the-canvas-in-react/&quot;&gt;animating in the canvas with React&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to use an animation as the header image. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video/&quot;&gt;A video was much smaller than using a comparable gif&lt;/a&gt; so I implemented the header as a video. When I came to check things in Safari I found it had stopped working and I had no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosing the problem&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I first thought it could have something to do with the CDN I&apos;m using. There were some false positives regarding streaming video through a CDN that resulted in some extra research that was ultimately fruitless. Once I&apos;d exhausted that line of inquiry I went back to the failing request.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Observing the request in Safari&apos;s inspector lead to further trawling the internet and eventually things started to add up. Safari was sending an initial request to fetch the video with a &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header set to &lt;code&gt;bytes=0-1&lt;/code&gt;. You see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/CreatingVideoforSafarioniPhone/CreatingVideoforSafarioniPhone.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006514-SW6&quot;&gt;Safari requires HTTP servers that are serving video and audio to support &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; requests like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nginx was serving correct responses to &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; requests. So was the CDN. The only other problem? The service worker. And this broke the video in Safari.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time to fix the service worker then. With inspiration from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/prefetch-video/&quot;&gt;example of caching videos from the Chrome team&lt;/a&gt;, here&apos;s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Range requests in Service Workers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My existing service worker implementation was checking for requests to my assets or images directories and responding with a cache then network strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;self.addEventListener(&apos;fetch&apos;, function(event) {\n  var url = new URL(event.request.url);\n  if (url.pathname.match(/^\\/((assets|images)\\/|manifest.json$)/)) {\n    event.respondWith(returnFromCacheOrFetch(event.request, staticCacheName));\n  }\n  // other strategies\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The video requests are going to be served from the assets or image directories, so this is the place to interject. I checked for the existence of the range header and responded with a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;self.addEventListener(&apos;fetch&apos;, function(event) {\n  var url = new URL(event.request.url);\n  if (url.pathname.match(/^\\/((assets|images)\\/|manifest.json$)/)) {\n    if (event.request.headers.get(&apos;range&apos;)) {\n      event.respondWith(returnRangeRequest(event.request, staticCacheName));\n    } else {\n      event.respondWith(returnFromCacheOrFetch(event.request, staticCacheName));\n    }\n  }\n  // other strategies\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, to implement &lt;code&gt;returnRangeRequest&lt;/code&gt;. This starts with a cache then network approach that you may have seen in a service worker before. The cache is opened and checked against the request. If there is a cached response it is returned and if it is not present in the cache it is fetched from the network, the response cloned and stored in the cache and the result returned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that the result is turned into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ArrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/arrayBuffer&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Response#arrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This will give us access to the raw bytes to build our response from later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function returnRangeRequest(request, cacheName) {\n  return caches\n    .open(cacheName)\n    .then(function(cache) {\n      return cache.match(request.url);\n    })\n    .then(function(res) {\n      if (!res) {\n        return fetch(request)\n          .then(res =&amp;gt; {\n            const clonedRes = res.clone();\n            return caches\n              .open(cacheName)\n              .then(cache =&amp;gt; cache.put(request, clonedRes))\n              .then(() =&amp;gt; res);\n          })\n          .then(res =&amp;gt; {\n            return res.arrayBuffer();\n          });\n      }\n      return res.arrayBuffer();\n    })\n    .then(...); // The rest goes here\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have an &lt;code&gt;arrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt;, from either the cache or network response, the real work starts. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header&lt;/a&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range: bytes=200-1000\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, the request is for the bytes between the 200th and 1000th byte of the response. The &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header may omit the end byte, meaning that it wants all the bytes from the first value until the end of the file. We can extract these figures with a little regular expression:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  }).then(function(arrayBuffer) {\n    const bytes = /^bytes\\=(\\d+)\\-(\\d+)?$/g.exec(\n      request.headers.get(&apos;range&apos;)\n    );\n    // and so on\n  });\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Breaking this regex down quickly, it looks for a string that starts with the &quot;bytes=&quot; followed by some digits a hyphen and optionally some more digits before the end of the string. The two sets of digits are captured, using the brackets, so that we can use them later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I check to see if the header satisfied the regex and if so, turn the start and end byte values into integers to index into the &lt;code&gt;arrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt;. If the end byte index is not present then it is set to the end of the file. With the byte indices the response can be generated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The body of the response is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer/slice&quot;&gt;slice&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;arrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt; from the start until the end defined by the &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header. The response carries a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206&quot;&gt;206 status&lt;/a&gt;, meaning partial content. It also requires a &lt;code&gt;Content-Range&lt;/code&gt; header, which is similar to the original &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; header. It tells the browser the response is made of the range of bytes and also returns the total size of the file.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the regex fails then the service worker will return a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/416&quot;&gt;416 error&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  }).then(function(arrayBuffer) {\n    const bytes = /^bytes\\=(\\d+)\\-(\\d+)?$/g.exec(\n      request.headers.get(&apos;range&apos;)\n    );\n    if (bytes) {\n      const start = Number(bytes[1]);\n      const end = Number(bytes[2]) || arrayBuffer.byteLength - 1;\n      return new Response(arrayBuffer.slice(start, end + 1), {\n        status: 206,\n        statusText: &apos;Partial Content&apos;,\n        headers: [\n          [&apos;Content-Range&apos;, `bytes ${start}-${end}/${arrayBuffer.byteLength}`]\n        ]\n      });\n    } else {\n      return new Response(null, {\n        status: 416,\n        statusText: &apos;Range Not Satisfiable&apos;,\n        headers: [[&apos;Content-Range&apos;, `*/${arrayBuffer.byteLength}`]]\n      });\n    }\n  });\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That fixed it. With a reload of the service worker my video started playing in all the browsers again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Service workers and browsers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/philna.sh/blob/ba798a2d5d8364fc7c1dae1819cbd8ef103c8b67/sw.js#L50-L94&quot;&gt;full function in my service worker on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s quite a lot of extra work just to get Safari to agree to display video, but it did teach me a bit about what browsers expect when loading video content, how to respond to more intricate requests within a service worker, and how picky Safari can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have this same problem, I hope my code helps. If you are using Workbox for a service worker it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-range-requests&quot;&gt;range request module&lt;/a&gt; that you can use for this too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you discovered this problem yourself or if you have another solution for this, I&apos;d love to hear about it. Just drop me a note on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;@philnash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I recently experimented with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/audio-visualisation-web-audio-api--react&quot;&gt;audio visualisation in React on the Twilio blog&lt;/a&gt;. While I meant to teach myself more about the web audio API I found that I picked up a few techniques for animating in canvas within a React project. If you&apos;re creating a canvas animation in React then perhaps this will help you too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Good references&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First up, if you&apos;ve used React before you&apos;ll know that you&apos;re supposed to avoid touching the &amp;lt;abbr title=&quot;Document Object Model&quot;&amp;gt;DOM&amp;lt;/abbr&amp;gt; and let React handle it. If you&apos;ve worked with an HTML5 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; before, you&apos;ll also know that to get a context with which to draw on the canvas, you need to call directly on the canvas element itself. Thankfully this is an edge case that &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html&quot;&gt;React supports through refs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To get a ref to a canvas element inside a React component you first need to create the ref in the constructor using &lt;code&gt;React.createRef&lt;/code&gt;. When you come to render the canvas element, add a prop called &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; that points to the ref you created.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Animation extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.canvasRef = React.createRef();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;canvas ref={this.canvasRef} /&amp;gt;\n      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you&apos;ve set it up this way, you can then refer to the canvas element through the ref&apos;s &lt;code&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; property, for example in &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  componentDidMount() {\n    const canvas = this.canvasRef.current;\n    const context = canvas.getContext(&apos;2d&apos;);\n    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n  }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you have the context you can draw and animate all you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Separating animation and drawing&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of building with React is about maintaining the state of the view. The first time I animated something on a canvas in React I held the state and the code to draw it in the same component. After browsing examples online, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/vasilly/pen/NRKyWL&quot;&gt;this rotating square on CodePen&lt;/a&gt;. What I really liked about this example was the way the state was separated from the drawing with the use of two components. The state of the drawing was then passed from the animating component to the drawing component through props.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I recreated the original to show the separation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First you define a &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; component that draws an image using the props as parameters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Canvas extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.canvasRef = React.createRef();\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    // Draws a square in the middle of the canvas rotated\n    // around the centre by this.props.angle\n    const { angle } = this.props;\n    const canvas = this.canvasRef.current;\n    const ctx = canvas.getContext(&apos;2d&apos;);\n    const width = canvas.width;\n    const height = canvas.height;\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);\n    ctx.translate(width / 2, height / 2);\n    ctx.rotate((angle * Math.PI) / 180);\n    ctx.fillStyle = &apos;#4397AC&apos;;\n    ctx.fillRect(-width / 4, -height / 4, width / 2, height / 2);\n    ctx.restore();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return &amp;lt;canvas width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; ref={this.canvasRef} /&amp;gt;;\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then you create an &lt;code&gt;Animation&lt;/code&gt; component that runs an animation loop using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each time the animation loop runs you update the parameters of the animation in the state and let React render the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; with the updated props.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t forget to implement &lt;code&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/code&gt; to stop the &lt;code&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; loop too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Animation extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { angle: 0 };\n    this.updateAnimationState = this.updateAnimationState.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.rAF = requestAnimationFrame(this.updateAnimationState);\n  }\n\n  updateAnimationState() {\n    this.setState(prevState =&amp;gt; ({ angle: prevState.angle + 1 }));\n    this.rAF = requestAnimationFrame(this.updateAnimationState);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    cancelAnimationFrame(this.rAF);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return &amp;lt;Canvas angle={this.state.angle} /&amp;gt;;\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/philnash/pen/QVeOrd&quot;&gt;this in action in this pen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Rerendering&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A concern when animating or doing other intensive visual updates in React is rerendering child elements too often, causing &lt;a href=&quot;http://jankfree.org/&quot;&gt;jank&lt;/a&gt;. When we are drawing on the canvas we never want the canvas element itself to be rerendered. So what&apos;s the best way to hint to React that we don&apos;t want that to happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lifecycle method. Returning &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; will let React know that this component doesn&apos;t need to change. However, if we&apos;re using the pattern above, returning &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; will skip running &lt;code&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; and that&apos;s responsible for our drawing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/49803151/28376&quot;&gt;this answer from Dan Abramov to a question on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;. We can create a &lt;code&gt;PureCanvas&lt;/code&gt; component that implements &lt;code&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; and returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#callback-refs&quot;&gt;callback ref&lt;/a&gt; to get the reference to the canvas element in a parent &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/49803151/28376&quot;&gt;Dan&apos;s answer&lt;/a&gt; he says that using the pattern above should be ok and the following technique is likely only necessary if you have profiled your application and found it makes a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Updating the example above, we split the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; component into a &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;PureCanvas&lt;/code&gt;. First, the &lt;code&gt;PureCanvas&lt;/code&gt; uses a callback ref and a callback provided through the props to return the canvas context to the parent component. It also renders the canvas element itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class PureCanvas extends React.Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate() {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &amp;lt;canvas\n        width=&quot;300&quot;\n        height=&quot;300&quot;\n        ref={node =&amp;gt;\n          node ? this.props.contextRef(node.getContext(&apos;2d&apos;)) : null\n        }\n      /&amp;gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; component passes a callback function, &lt;code&gt;saveContext&lt;/code&gt;, as the &lt;code&gt;contextRef&lt;/code&gt; prop when rendering the &lt;code&gt;PureCanvas&lt;/code&gt;. When the function is called we save the context (and cache the canvas element&apos;s width and height). The rest of the differences from before are turning references to &lt;code&gt;ctx&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;this.ctx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Canvas extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.saveContext = this.saveContext.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  saveContext(ctx) {\n    this.ctx = ctx;\n    this.width = this.ctx.canvas.width;\n    this.height = this.ctx.canvas.height;\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    const { angle } = this.props;\n    this.ctx.save();\n    this.ctx.beginPath();\n    this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.width, this.height);\n    this.ctx.translate(this.width / 2, this.height / 2);\n    this.ctx.rotate((angle * Math.PI) / 180);\n    this.ctx.fillStyle = &apos;#4397AC&apos;;\n    this.ctx.fillRect(\n      -this.width / 4,\n      -this.height / 4,\n      this.width / 2,\n      this.height / 2\n    );\n    this.ctx.restore();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return &amp;lt;PureCanvas contextRef={this.saveContext} /&amp;gt;;\n  }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even though it is not necessary, I find this separation between animation, drawing and rendering the canvas element itself quite pleasing. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/philnash/pen/pxzVzw&quot;&gt;see this example in action on CodePen too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Canvas vs React&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been an interesting journey working with a canvas element within React. The way they work feels very different to each other, so getting them in sync wasn&apos;t necessarily straightforward. Hopefully if you have this problem then these techniques can help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re interested in other animations in React, do please check out my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/audio-visualisation-web-audio-api--react&quot;&gt;audio visualisation in React&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have another way of working with canvas in React I&apos;d love to hear.

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crystal-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt; is still a young language, there aren&apos;t a lot of libraries available yet. For some this could be offputting, but for others this is a chance to learn about a language and provide useful tools for those also starting to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve given a &lt;a href=&quot;/speaking/history/&quot;&gt;number of talks&lt;/a&gt; over time, some of which were about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WipxMQjssRE&quot;&gt;two factor authentication&lt;/a&gt;. A while back I took the opportunity to improve my knowledge and implement the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_algorithm&quot;&gt;one time password algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This lead me to build the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp&quot;&gt;CrOTP library for one time passwords in Crystal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out the code, most of the important implementation can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp/blob/master/src/crotp/otp.cr&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CrOTP::OTP&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp/blob/master/src/crotp/hotp.cr&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CrOTP::HOTP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp/blob/master/src/crotp/totp.cr&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CrOTP::TOTP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; classes take care of the different ways the counter is treated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Using CrOTP&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To use the CrOTP library in your own Crystal project you need to add it to the dependencies in your &lt;code&gt;shard.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dependencies:\n  crotp:\n    github: philnash/crotp\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then install the dependencies with &lt;code&gt;shards install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you can &lt;code&gt;require &quot;crotp&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and use it in your application. Most uses on the web of one time passwords are time based tokens for two factor authentication. Here&apos;s how to generate and verify time based OTPs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First require the library and generate a random string to use as the secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;crotp&quot;\n\nsecret = Random.new.hex(16)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then create an instance of the &lt;code&gt;CrOTP::TOTP&lt;/code&gt; class with that secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;totp = CrOTP::TOTP.new(secret)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Sharing secrets&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can generate a URI that can be shared with authenticator apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://authy.com/&quot;&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt; or Google Authenticator. To do so call &lt;code&gt;authenticator_uri&lt;/code&gt; with the name of your app as the issuer and the user account&apos;s username as the user.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;totp.authenticator_uri(issuer: &quot;Test app&quot;, user: &quot;philnash@example.com&quot;)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turn the resulting URI into a QR code and users can scan it to add the account to their app.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Generating and verifying&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you can use the &lt;code&gt;totp&lt;/code&gt; object to generate a new one time password that will be valid within the current 30 second period of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;password = totp.generate\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To verify a code, you can use the same object, calling &lt;code&gt;verify&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;totp.verify(password)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can also allow a drift, to give users more time to enter their code. The drift is the number of periods (periods are 30 seconds long by default) that can pass after the token was generated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;totp.verify(password, at: Time.now, allowed_drift: 2)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp/blob/master/example/crotp.cr&quot;&gt;more examples in the project repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;There&apos;s more work to be done&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp&quot;&gt;CrOTP&lt;/a&gt; does the basic work for generating and verifying one time passwords. Of course, there&apos;s more &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/crotp#todo&quot;&gt;to do on the project&lt;/a&gt; when I find the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d love to hear if this project is useful to you or if you&apos;re interested in helping implement the missing features.

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve seen the following tweet about git making its way around Twitter recently:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;I ❤️ Git. But honestly, it intimidated me for years. I thought I needed to understand all its powerful features to be productive. I found that&apos;s not the case. You can be quite productive in Git with around 6 commands: &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;branch&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;checkout&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;add&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;commit&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;pull&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;push&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;— Cory House 🏠 (@housecor) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1031190760278970368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;August 19, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And it&apos;s true, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do most of your work with those commands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if you want to fork and contribute to an open source project on GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket though? You&apos;re going to need a few more commands so that you can keep your fork up to date, namely &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;. Let&apos;s see how they are used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Fork away&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you fork a project, you make a copy of it under your own namespace. To work with the project you then clone the repository to your own machine. Let&apos;s use a repo I have forked as an example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/twilio-node&quot;&gt;Twilio&apos;s Node.js package&lt;/a&gt;. After forking, we clone the repo:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:philnash/twilio-node.git\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can now see the first use case for &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt;. Run &lt;code&gt;git remote&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;twilio-node&lt;/code&gt; directory and we see the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote\norigin\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OK, that&apos;s not too useful, it just shows we have one remote repo called &quot;origin&quot;. Running it again with the &lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt; flag shows a bit more information:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote --verbose\norigin\tgit@github.com:philnash/twilio-node.git (fetch)\norigin\tgit@github.com:philnash/twilio-node.git (push)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s better, this shows that the remote repository is the one we cloned and that we can fetch from and push to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Making changes&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When contributing something back to the repo, it is easiest to do so on a branch. That keeps the master branch clean and makes it easy to keep up to date. Setting up your changes is covered by the six commands Cory listed in his tweet; you create a new branch with &lt;code&gt;branch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;checkout&lt;/code&gt; the branch, make the changes you want, &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; as many times as necessary and finally &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; the branch to the origin, your fork. Then you can create your pull request and hope it gets accepted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometime later down the line you find you want to make another pull request, but the original repo has moved on. You need to update your fork so that you&apos;re working with the latest code. You could delete your fork and go through the process of forking and cloning the repo again, but that&apos;s a lot of unnecessary work. Instead, add the upstream repository as another remote for the repo and work with it from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Adding the upstream&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To do this, we use the &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; command again, this time to &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; a new remote. Find the original repo&apos;s URL and add it as a new remote. By convention this remote is called &quot;upstream&quot; though you can call it whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote add upstream git@github.com:twilio/twilio-node.git\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now if we inspect the repo&apos;s remotes again, we will see both the origin and the upstream. You can use &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; as a shortcut for &lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git remote -v\norigin\t  git@github.com:philnash/twilio-node.git (fetch)\norigin\t  git@github.com:philnash/twilio-node.git (push)\nupstream\tgit@github.com:twilio/twilio-node.git (fetch)\nupstream\tgit@github.com:twilio/twilio-node.git (push)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Fetching the latest&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To bring the repo up to date, we can now &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; the latest from the upstream repo. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch upstream\nremote: Counting objects: 6427, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (549/549), done.\nremote: Total 6427 (delta 5156), reused 5105 (delta 4939), pack-reused 934\nReceiving objects: 100% (6427/6427), 2.54 MiB | 1.28 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (5399/5399), completed with 391 local objects.\nFrom github.com:twilio/twilio-node\n   6a6733a8..73656c50  master           -&amp;gt; upstream/master\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch&lt;/code&gt; downloads objects and refs from the repository, but doesn&apos;t apply it to the branch we are working on. We want to apply the updates to the master branch, so make sure it is checked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout master\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Merging it all together&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To bring the master branch up to date with the remote &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; the remote&apos;s master branch into our own, like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git merge upstream/master\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have kept your work off the master branch this will go ahead smoothly. Finally &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; these updates to the fork so that it is up to date too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin master\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now everything on the master branch of the fork is up to date. If you need to update a different branch, substitute the branch name master for the branch you are working with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have been working with &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; then you may have already seen a potential shortcut. &lt;code&gt;pull&lt;/code&gt; is the combination of &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;, so to perform these two actions in one command you can run:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull upstream master\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Fork happy&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s all you need to know for keeping your fork up to date when contributing to open source. Add the upstream as a new &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; repo, &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; the upstream repo and &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; the branch you want to update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more detail on the various commands here, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes&quot;&gt;&quot;Working with Remotes&quot; from the Pro Git book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And remember, if you get stuck with something with git, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://ohshitgit.com/&quot;&gt;Oh shit, git!&lt;/a&gt; for all your expletive based ways to save yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Happy forking!&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Development machines can build up such a lot of cruft. Old versions, oudated programs and unused caches litter the hard drive. It&apos;s good to take time once in a while to clean all of this up and free up some space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips for commands you can run or actions you can take to clean up your machine. If you have a tip that I&apos;m missing here, please share it with me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; to manage packages on macOS you can run &lt;code&gt;brew cleanup&lt;/code&gt; to remove old versions of packages and old downloads from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew cleanup\nRemoving: ...\n...\n==&amp;gt; This operation has freed approximately 6.9GB of disk space.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; flag scrubs the downloads for the latest package versions from the cache to give you back even more space. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DavidGuyon&quot;&gt;David Guyon&lt;/a&gt; for that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DavidGuyon/status/995038050341281792&quot;&gt;tip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To really turn it up to the max, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dalanmiller&quot;&gt;Daniel Miller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dalanmiller/status/994729616077082624&quot;&gt;suggested a bash alias&lt;/a&gt; to update Homebrew, upgrade packages and then cleanup after yourself. Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alias bu=&quot;brew update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew upgrade &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew cleanup&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then run the commands with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bu\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Everything should be up to date and leave no mess behind!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Homebrew bonus&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once all the caches have been tidied up, take a moment to make sure Homebrew  itself is running smoothly. Run the following command for a list of actions you can take to tidy up your install.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew doctor\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Docker&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few gigabytes of packages is a pretty good, but can we do better? If you&apos;re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; you can clean things up with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker volume prune\n...\nTotal reclaimed space: 40.77GB\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a big Docker user myself, this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JackWeirdy/status/991637143612215296&quot;&gt;a tip from Jack Wearden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Rubies&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I install multiple versions of Ruby using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv&quot;&gt;rbenv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build&quot;&gt;ruby-build&lt;/a&gt;. I just checked the versions I have installed and I found 12 Rubies that are beyond end of life. Since they also have their gems installed alongside them, clearing them out saved me tens to hundreds of megabytes per Ruby version.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can check the versions you have installed with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rbenv versions\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can then uninstall an unwanted version of Ruby with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rbenv uninstall 2.1.0\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Nodes&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/creationix/nvm&quot;&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt; to manage multiple versions of Node.js. The drill is the same here as with Ruby. Find the old Node versions that you have hanging around with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm ls\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then uninstall with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm uninstall v6.9.2\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Any other ideas?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That should clear up a bunch of space on your machine, it sure did on mine. Now you have more room for more installs, more containers and more versions of more languages!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d love to collect any other tips that you might have to keep a development machine running smooth and lean. Let me know how you spring clean your development machine on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;@philnash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;Dust icon by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/smalllike/collection/cleaning/?i=1683969&quot;&amp;gt;Smalllike from the Noun Project&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

I think I&apos;ve done it and I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image-left&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/web-share-wrapper/android-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;When you press the share button on Android, the share tray will appear.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve built a web component called &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It is a wrapper because it is intended to wrap around any existing elements that you might already be using as share buttons to various social networks and replace them with a single element that uses the web share API.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are using Chrome on Android (the only current browser that supports the web share API) then you can check out the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in action. Either scroll to the bottom of this article and click the share link or take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://philnash.github.io/web-share-wrapper/&quot;&gt;the examples in the repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are instructions for using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-share-wrapper/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;readme on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but here&apos;s a quick example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper text=&quot;Share&quot; sharetext=&quot;Check out the web-share-wrapper web component&quot; shareurl=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-share-wrapper&quot;&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Check%20out%20%40philnash&apos;s%20web-share-wrapper%20web%20component&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fphilnash%2Fweb-share-wrapper&quot;&amp;gt;Share on Twitter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the web share API is not available, the above HTML will just be a link to share the project via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button/web-intent&quot;&gt;Twitter tweet intent&lt;/a&gt;. If the web share API is available, then the web component will kick in and replace the link with a button that, when clicked, will invoke the web share API. The button text is supplied by the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute, the &lt;code&gt;sharetext&lt;/code&gt; attribute sets the body of the share and the &lt;code&gt;shareurl&lt;/code&gt; sets the link to share.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The button is injected into the regular DOM, not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM&quot;&gt;shadow DOM&lt;/a&gt;, so you can style it using regular CSS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Getting fancy with templates&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If a plain button isn&apos;t your style, the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; also supports using HTML templates. Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute to set the button text, use a &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; attribute to point to the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on the page and the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will hydrate that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and insert it in place of the content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the following code will use an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template id=&quot;link&quot;&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;Share link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper template=&quot;link&quot; sharetext=&quot;Check out the web-share-wrapper web component&quot; shareurl=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-share-wrapper&quot;&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Check%20out%20%40philnash&apos;s%20web-share-wrapper%20web%20component&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fphilnash%2Fweb-share-wrapper&quot;&amp;gt;Share on Twitter&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Again, you can style the contents of the template anyway you like. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://philnash.github.io/web-share-wrapper/&quot;&gt;examples in the repo show a fancier button with an icon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Installing  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;web-share-wrapper&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The web component is published to Bower and you can install it to a project with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bower install --save web-share-wrapper\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am investigating other ways of publishing this web component as, while webcomponents.org seems to favour publishing to Bower, this doesn&apos;t seem like the best long term plan for a project. Support for npm seems like the most important next step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What do you think?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can now use the web share API declaratively, with just a single web component. I&apos;d love to know your thoughts on how this has been implemented and whether you think it&apos;s a good idea. Let me know on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;@philnash&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/web-share-wrapper/issues&quot;&gt;issues on the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors&quot;&gt;whole bunch of CSS selectors&lt;/a&gt; available to web developers, but sometimes there&apos;s still not enough. I found this recently when building the &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/speaking/&quot;&gt;speaking section of my site&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to use the non-existent &lt;code&gt;:first-of-class&lt;/code&gt; pseudo class to apply some styles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The pseudo class &lt;code&gt;:first-of-type&lt;/code&gt; does exist, but it is limited. It is a special case of the &lt;code&gt;:nth-of-type()&lt;/code&gt; pseudo class. From the spec (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The :nth-of-type(An+B) pseudo-class notation represents the same elements that would be matched by :nth-child(|An+B| of S), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;where S is a type selector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and namespace prefix matching the element in question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That means, when using &lt;code&gt;:nth-of-type()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:first-of-type&lt;/code&gt; the selector can only be a type selector. That is, you can only refer directly to elements—like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;—when using &lt;code&gt;:first-of-type&lt;/code&gt;. So, if you had the following HTML:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is paragraph 1&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;p class=&quot;special&quot;&amp;gt;This is paragraph 2&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;p class=&quot;special&quot;&amp;gt;This is paragraph 3&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And this CSS:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;div p { color: #333; }\ndiv p:first-of-type { color: red; }\ndiv p.special:first-of-type { color: green; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might expect paragraph 1 to be coloured red and paragraph 2 to be coloured green. But &lt;code&gt;div p.special&lt;/code&gt; is not a type selector, so &lt;code&gt;:first-of-type&lt;/code&gt; doesn&apos;t apply here and nothing is green.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The subsequent sibling combinator&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This can be solved with a technique created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717480/css-selector-for-first-element-with-class&quot;&gt;Daniel Tan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5287272/css-select-first-element-with-a-certain-class/5293095#5293095&quot;&gt;Lea Verou&lt;/a&gt; and shared on Stack Overflow. Rather than using pseudo classes at all, we can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#general-sibling-combinators&quot;&gt;subsequent or general sibling combinator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The subsequent sibling combinator looks like &lt;code&gt;A ~ B&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; are two compound selectors (not just type selectors). It allows you to select &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; share a parent and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; precedes &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; in the document.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the following HTML, the selector &lt;code&gt;h2 ~ p&lt;/code&gt; would select the second &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as it follows the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but not the first &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Heading&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meta data&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Subheading&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some article text&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The subsequent sibling combinator and :first-of-class&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The trick to using the combinator to emulate a &lt;code&gt;:first-of-class&lt;/code&gt; psuedo class is to use a regular selector to style all the elements of the class with the style you want. Then use the combinator to turn it off for all but the first element. In our original example, the CSS now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;div p { color: #333; }\ndiv p:first-of-type { color: red; }\ndiv p.special { color: green; }\ndiv p.special ~ p.special { color: #333; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the first paragraph will be red, the second green and the last one grey. You can check out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/philnash/pen/WzoNwG/&quot;&gt;live example of this on Codepen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;CSS Selectors level 4&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After posting this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simevidas&quot;&gt;Šime Vidas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simevidas/status/975394813863432192&quot;&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the future of CSS holds more promise for this style of selector. In the CSS Selectors level 4 specification the &lt;code&gt;:nth-child()&lt;/code&gt; pseudo class takes an argument that looks like: &lt;code&gt;An+B [of S]?&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;An+B&lt;/code&gt; part means you can provide a function to calculate what &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is, but the optional &lt;code&gt;of S&lt;/code&gt; means the pseudo class will match the Nth element that matches the selector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This means we can update our example to use &lt;code&gt;:nth-child()&lt;/code&gt; instead of two rules like we did above. Check out the CSS below:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;div p { color: #333; }\ndiv p:first-of-type { color: red; }\ndiv :nth-child(1 of p.special) { color: green; }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;:nth-child(1 of p.special)&lt;/code&gt; means we are selecting the first child of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that is a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a class of &quot;special&quot;. This is exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only drawback with this technique? It only works in Safari right now. I&apos;ve updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/philnash/pen/WzoNwG/&quot;&gt;Codepen, check it out in Safari to see all your future selector dreams come true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;CSS hacking is still fun&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been writing CSS on and off for more than a decade now and while all the modern layout capabilities of CSS mean that there&apos;s a lot less hacking, sometimes you need to come up with a creative solution to a problem. I could have solved this with an extra class or a rearrangement of my HTML, but when CSS can do the job for you it feels more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Daniel and Lea for sharing their solutions on Stack Overflow and particularly to Daniel who&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717480/css-selector-for-first-element-with-class/8539107#8539107&quot;&gt;answer goes into a lot more detail about CSS selector and pseudo class misunderstandings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day we&apos;ll see a &lt;code&gt;:first-of-class&lt;/code&gt; pseudo class. With the latest version of &lt;code&gt;:nth-child()&lt;/code&gt; maybe we don&apos;t even need a &lt;code&gt;:first-of-class&lt;/code&gt;, we&apos;re just waiting for browser support. In the meantime the subsequent sibling combinator remains our friend.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year I looked into how to better compress the output of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; site. I&apos;ll write up the results to that soon. For now, here&apos;s how to gzip a file using Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Enter zlib&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Contained within the Ruby standard library is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Zlib&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt; which gives access to the underlying &lt;a href=&quot;https://zlib.net/&quot;&gt;zlib library&lt;/a&gt;. It is used to read and write files in gzip format. Here&apos;s a small program to read in a file, compress it and save it as a gzip file.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;zlib&quot;\n\ndef compress_file(file_name)\n  zipped = &quot;#{file_name}.gz&quot;\n\n  Zlib::GzipWriter.open(zipped) do |gz|\n    gz.write IO.binread(file_name)\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can use any IO or IO-like object with &lt;code&gt;Zlib::GzipWriter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can enhance this by adding the files original name into the compressed output. Also, it can be beneficial to set the file&apos;s modified time to the same as the original, particularly if you are using the file with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.html&quot;&gt;nginx&apos;s &lt;code&gt;gzip_static&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;zlib&quot;\n\ndef compress_file(file_name)\n  zipped = &quot;#{file_name}.gz&quot;\n\n  Zlib::GzipWriter.open(zipped) do |gz|\n    gz.mtime = File.mtime(file_name)\n    gz.orig_name = file_name\n    gz.write IO.binread(file_name)\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just to see how well this is working, we can print some statistics from the compression.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require &quot;zlib&quot;\n\ndef print_stats(file_name, zipped)\n  original_size = File.size(file_name)\n  zipped_size = File.size(zipped)\n  percentage_difference = ((original_size - zipped_size).to_f/original_size)*100\n  puts &quot;#{file_name}: #{original_size}&quot;\n  puts &quot;#{zipped}: #{zipped_size}&quot;\n  puts &quot;difference - #{&apos;%.2f&apos; % percentage_difference}%&quot;\nend\n\ndef compress_file(file_name)\n  zipped = &quot;#{file_name}.gz&quot;\n\n  Zlib::GzipWriter.open(zipped) do |gz|\n    gz.mtime = File.mtime(file_name)\n    gz.orig_name = file_name\n    gz.write IO.binread(file_name)\n  end\n\n  print_stats(file_name, zipped)\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now you can pick a file and compress it with Ruby and gzip. For this quick test, I chose the uncompressed, unminified jQuery version 3.3.1. The results were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./jquery.js: 271751\n./jquery.js.gz: 80669\ndifference - 70.32%\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty good, but we can squeeze more out of it if we try a little harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Compression levels&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Zlib::GzipWriter&lt;/code&gt; takes a second argument to &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; which is the level of compression zlib applies. 0 is no compression and 9 is the best possible compression and there&apos;s a trade off as you progress from 0 to 9 between speed and compression. The default compression is a good compromise between speed and compression, but if time isn&apos;t a worry for you then you might as well make the file as small as possible, especially if you want to serve it over the web. To set the compression level to 9 you can just use the integer, but &lt;code&gt;Zlib&lt;/code&gt; has a convenient constant for it: &lt;code&gt;Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Changing the line with &lt;code&gt;Zlib::GzipWriter&lt;/code&gt; in it to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Zlib::GzipWriter.open(zipped, Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION) do |gz|\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and running the file against jQuery again gives you:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./jquery.js: 271751\n./jquery.js.gz: 80268\ndifference - 70.46%\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A difference of 0.14 percentage points! Ok, not a huge win, but if the time to generate the file doesn&apos;t matter then you might as well. And the difference is greater on even larger files.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Streaming gzip&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s one last thing you might want to add. If you are compressing really large files, loading them entirely into memory isn&apos;t the most efficient way to work. Gzip is a streaming format though, so you can write chunks at a time to it. In this case, you just need to read the file you are compressing incrementally and write the chunks to the &lt;code&gt;GzipWriter&lt;/code&gt;. Here&apos;s what it would look like to read the file in chunks of 16kb:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def compress_file(file_name)\n  zipped = &quot;#{file_name}.gz&quot;\n\n  Zlib::GzipWriter.open(zipped, Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION) do |gz|\n    gz.mtime = File.mtime(file_name)\n    gz.orig_name = file_name\n    File.open(file_name) do |file|\n      while chunk = file.read(16*1024) do\n        gz.write(chunk)\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;gzip in Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So that is how to gzip a file using Ruby and zlib, as well as how to add extra information and control the compression level to balance speed against final filesize. All of this went into a gem I created recently to use maximum gzip compression on the output of a Jekyll site. The gem is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/jekyll-gzip&quot;&gt;jekyll-gzip&lt;/a&gt; and I&apos;ll be writing more about it, as well as other tools that are better than the zlib implementation of gzip, soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;Header icons: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/term/diamond/315/&quot;&amp;gt;Diamond by Edward Boatman&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=vice&amp;amp;i=1554537&quot;&amp;gt;vice by Daniel Luft&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from the Noun Project.&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of progressive web apps and the powers that they bestow on web developers to build the next generation of applications. We can write web applications that work offline, &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/blog/2017/07/04/experimenting-with-the-background-fetch-api/&quot;&gt;download large files in the background&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/02/web-powered-sms-inbox-with-service-worker-push-notifications.html&quot;&gt;send push notifications&lt;/a&gt;, and much more. I was so excited about push notifications on the web that I wrote a whole talk about it in 2015 and was fortunate enough to give it in a bunch of places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;post-video&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-WnlHhqcjU?t=14&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps I was a little too prescient with that talk title, &quot;The web is getting pushy.&quot; Web applications themselves are getting pushy and now I see tweets like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;Dear Every Single Website in Existence,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;No, I do not want Notifications turned on.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Thanks,&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Dan&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;— Dan Szymborski (@DSzymborski) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DSzymborski/status/921260402146672641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;October 20, 2017&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;Dear websites: no one wants push notifications. Love, every person who uses the internet&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;— Andrea Whitmer (@nutsandbolts) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nutsandbolts/status/925421346259193862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;October 31, 2017&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And blog posts like How-To Geek&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/288946/how-to-stop-websites-from-asking-to-show-notifications/&quot;&gt;how to stop websites from asking to show notifications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Push notifications are getting a bad reputation and I don&apos;t think they deserve it. Here are the problems I think we are facing with this and some potential solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;It&apos;s not the fault of the notifications&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have a theory. It&apos;s not that users don&apos;t want push notifications. There is a time and a place for a good push notification. Native mobile application developers seem to be getting this right now, at least in my experience, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-guardian-mobile-innovation-lab/generating-images-in-javascript-without-using-the-canvas-api-77f3f4355fad&quot;&gt;innovative web teams like those at the Guardian have done some really interesting and impressive push notification experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image-left&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/permissions/guardian.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Guardian&apos;s experiment with creating images for the current state of the UK General Election entirely within a push notification.&quot; class=&quot;post-image-left&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My theory is that users might want push notifications. They might want them for newsworthy moments, like the Guardian&apos;s election night experiments. They might want notifications that someone has sent them a message or that their taxi is arriving or their flight has been delayed. There are countless reasons a user might want to receive push notifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the top way to annoy any user is to pop up that permission dialog asking to send push notifications on page load without any context, any information at all, that would allow them to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/permissions/sitepoint.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sitepoint pops up a permissions dialog on page load&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed &lt;a href=&quot;http://sitepoint.com/&quot;&gt;Sitepoint&lt;/a&gt;, a web tutorial site that really should know better, doing this. And other well known sites; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/&quot;&gt;cnet&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in their early experimentation with the feature, have been spotted doing it too. There are probably many more examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These permission dialogs suck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Permission for what?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read that dialog from the screenshot again. All it says is &quot;www.sitepoint.com wants to show notifications&quot; and there are two buttons, &quot;Block&quot; or &quot;Allow&quot;. It doesn&apos;t say what the notifications will contain, how often they might be sent, why the user should even care. That permission dialog can&apos;t say that. There is nothing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PushManager&lt;/code&gt; API&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to add any context to a popup like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that the intention for the API is to encourage developers to build an intermediary step where the application explains why it wants permission to send push notifications. Then when the user agrees to that, trigger the real permission notification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a pattern that Matt Gaunt explains beautifully with his airline example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/permission-ux&quot;&gt;his article on permissions UX&lt;/a&gt;. The real key to each of the patterns in Matt&apos;s article is that the permission dialog never surprises the user, they always know why they are being asked permission by the browser to send notifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Permissions solved&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If everyone just reads Matt&apos;s article and implements friendly patterns for asking for permission then everything is solved, right? If only.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t matter how good an article on UX is or how many people read it, it can&apos;t reach everyone. So we still end up with permissions popping up at page load. You might think that this is just bad for the site that is providing the poor experience, but check those tweets at the start of this post. They don&apos;t care any more, they never want notifications. They want to be able to turn them all off for good. And they can, that&apos;s what the How-To Geek article explains. Firefox is soon releasing a global disable option too, and if you read the responses you&apos;ll see that this is being welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;There is now a global &quot;disable&quot; option for all push notification prompts&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/b01ZCoWOfK&quot;&amp;gt;https://t.co/b01ZCoWOfK&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0JSSYoaysb&quot;&amp;gt;pic.twitter.com/0JSSYoaysb&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;— Firefox Nightly (@FirefoxNightly) &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FirefoxNightly/status/950321939129815040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&amp;gt;January 8, 2018&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that all these poor experiences with permissions are causing users to revoke the permission not just from the offending sites but from the entire platform. Once notifications are turned off globally, it&apos;s almost impossible to get users to turn them back on again. Now, even if you&apos;ve built the best push notification permission flow, a user who has outright blocked notifications will never see it and never experience your application the way you built it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think we need more than just best practice UX articles to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Power to the browser&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the power is in the hands of the browsers. We&apos;ve seen them deal with unnecessary popups before. Remember, back in the day, installing popup blockers because the web was a fraught mess of windows popping up everywhere. Now every browser has a built in popup blocker. Most of what these built in popup blockers do is restrict the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.open&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt; to only work on user interaction. This means that users browsing the web don&apos;t end up with a whole bunch of unexpected popups or worse, popunders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to see the same for permission dialogs. If the browsers enforced a user interaction before you could show a permission dialog then the page load permission dialog would disappear immediately. The platform would then encourage all developers to explain the permission before asking for it and lead to better experiences all round.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Together we can save permissions&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s going to be a team effort, but I think we can save permissions dialogs, push notifications and the web platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Developers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: never show a permissions dialog on page load, instead read &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/permission-ux&quot;&gt;Matt Gaunt&apos;s article on permission UX&lt;/a&gt; and build better experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Browsers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: please consider a permissions popup blocker and encourage developers to build better applications by making poor experiences harder to build.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Users&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: don&apos;t block all permissions, please, you might be missing out on something really useful somewhere else on the web.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope we can all agree that there are uses for push notifications, what we really need to fix are the permissions.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I had the fortune of attending the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://brightonruby.com/&quot;&gt;Brighton Ruby conference&lt;/a&gt; last week. It was full of excellent advice, wisdom and code. There was one talk, however, that urged me to go home and do something straight away to ensure the security and usability of my projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/teabass&quot;&gt;Andrew Nesbitt&lt;/a&gt;, with the backing of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://libraries.io/data&quot;&gt;libraries.io open data&lt;/a&gt;, told tales of the hidden costs of open source software in Ruby and beyond. &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/andrew/can-my-friends-come-too&quot;&gt;His slides are available here&lt;/a&gt; and I will link to the video when it is published.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Counting the costs&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There were two take aways from Andrew&apos;s talk that could be acted on immediately: check up on security vulnerabilities and license issues in my projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Security audits&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubysec.com/&quot;&gt;Rubysec&lt;/a&gt; maintains the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db&quot;&gt;Ruby Advisory Database&lt;/a&gt;, a database of vulnerable Ruby gems. The database currently contains 287 advisories across 147 gems. If you&apos;re worried that your project depends on a vulnerable gem they publish &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit&quot;&gt;bundler-audit&lt;/a&gt;, which is a gem that audits &lt;code&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt;s against the their database.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To use bundler-audit you need to install it:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gem install bundler-audit\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and run it in your project directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ bundle-audit\nNo vulnerabilities found\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Second opinions&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If one security audit isn&apos;t enough to quell your fears then you are in luck. While it isn&apos;t a Ruby tool and Andrew didn&apos;t mention it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/&quot;&gt;Snyk&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for monitoring vulnerabilities in Ruby, JavaScript and Java projects via their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/vuln/&quot;&gt;vulnerability database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They publish a &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk&quot;&gt;command line interface&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to check your applications. You do need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://snyk.io/signup&quot;&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt; to use it and install Node.js and npm to run it. Once over those hurdles you can install and run it against your project like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install\n$ npm install -g snyk\n# authenticate the client\n$ snyk auth\n# test the project in the current directory\n$ snyk test\n✓ Tested 23 dependencies for known vulnerabilities, no vulnerable paths found.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now security has been checked, how about licenses?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Licensing audits&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unlicensed code is copyrighted code that you do not have the permission to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This may not sound bad until you hear that &lt;em&gt;28% of all Ruby gems have no license declared&lt;/em&gt;. That is over 37,000 gems. And you don&apos;t need to worry about just the gems that you install, but their dependencies. And their dependencies. And their... it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully there is a tool to check this too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;license_finder&lt;/code&gt; is maintained by Pivotal&lt;/a&gt; and checks your dependencies for licenses. The tool reports back with each dependency&apos;s license. You then have to decide whether the license fits with your project. You can choose to accept each of your dependencies and you can bulk accept by whitelisting certain licenses. If you&apos;re not using Ruby, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder#supported-project-types&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;license_finder&lt;/code&gt; works with many types of project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You install &lt;code&gt;license_finder&lt;/code&gt; with Ruby gems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gem install license_finder\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then you run it within a project directory. This was the result when I ran it against &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/envyable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;envyable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ license_finder\n..............................................................................\nDependencies that need approval:\nbundler, 1.12.5, MIT\ncodeclimate-test-reporter, 1.0.8, MIT\ndocile, 1.1.5, MIT\nenvyable, 1.2.0, MIT\nminitest, 5.10.2, MIT\nrake, 12.0.0, MIT\nsimplecov, 0.13.0, MIT\nsimplecov-html, 0.10.1, MIT\nthor, 0.19.4, MIT\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then, when I whitelist the MIT license and run it again:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ license_finder whitelist add MIT\n$ license_finder\n..............................................................................\nAll dependencies are approved for use\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The licenses are approved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Test all the time&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether there is a security vulnerability or an unlicensed project you could be subjecting yourself or your users to problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t take long to install and run these tools and I encourage you to do so too, they may save you from your dependencies. It takes a little longer, but it&apos;s probably worth it, to add them to your CI setup too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To find out more look out for the video of Andrew&apos;s talk, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://libraries.io/&quot;&gt;libraries.io&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://libraries.io/unlicensed-libraries&quot;&gt;libraries without licenses&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://libraries.io/data&quot;&gt;take a dive into the data&lt;/a&gt; and see what you can find out about our open source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;The service worker API is expanding as more ways to use the background dwelling worker emerge. I&apos;ve written before about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/02/web-powered-sms-inbox-with-service-worker-push-notifications.html&quot;&gt;push notifications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/send-messages-when-youre-back-online-with-service-workers-and-background-sync.html&quot;&gt;background sync&lt;/a&gt; and I recently explored the very new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/background-fetch&quot;&gt;background fetch API&lt;/a&gt;. Here&apos;s what I found out about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Downloads and uploads&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The background fetch API seeks to solve two problem:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When a service worker is downloading large files to cache and the user navigates away, even when using &lt;code&gt;event.waitUntil&lt;/code&gt; the service worker may eventually be killed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When uploading files and the user navigates away the upload is interrupted and will fail&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The background fetch API allows a developer to perform and control fetches to large files or lists of files outside the context of a single page. This can increase the likelihood of successful uploads and downloads and allow the service worker to cache the results too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This API is available to test, at the time of writing, in Chrome with the experimental web platform features flag turned on in the chrome://flags settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Testing out an example&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To try to understand how the API worked, I decided to build a simple proof of concept. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://fan-hubcap.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;example can be found here on Glitch&lt;/a&gt; or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/service-worker-background-fetch&quot;&gt;check out and run the source code from GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&apos;t want to mess around with large files, so this example tries to load an image that has a 10 second delay on it (4.5 seconds on Glitch).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a service worker set up to serve the image directly from the cache if it is present, otherwise it goes to the network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// sw.js\nself.addEventListener(&apos;fetch&apos;, function(event) {\n  if (event.request.url.match(/images/)) {\n    event.respondWith(\n      caches.open(&apos;downloads&apos;).then(cache =&amp;gt; {\n        return cache.match(event.request).then(response =&amp;gt; {\n          return response || fetch(event.request);\n        });\n      })\n    );\n  } else {\n    event.respondWith(caches.match(event.request));\n  }\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty standard service worker stuff so far, here&apos;s the new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the &quot;Start download&quot; button will kick off a background fetch. The fetch is tagged &apos;large-file&apos; (I was feeling creative). While the background fetch is going on, you can navigate away from the page, the download will continue to work in the background.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// index.html\nif (&apos;serviceWorker&apos; in navigator) {\n  navigator.serviceWorker.register(&apos;/sw.js&apos;).then(function(reg) {\n    const button = document.getElementById(&apos;download&apos;);\n    if (&apos;backgroundFetch&apos; in reg) {\n      button.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;, function(event) {\n        reg.backgroundFetch.fetch(&apos;large-file&apos;, [new Request(&apos;/images/twilio.png&apos;)], {\n          title: &apos;Downloading large image&apos;\n        }).then(function(backgroundFetch) { console.log(backgroundFetch) });\n      })\n    }\n  });\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the download is complete the service worker receives the &lt;code&gt;backgroundfetched&lt;/code&gt; event. The event has a &lt;code&gt;fetches&lt;/code&gt; property that points to an array of objects containing each request and response. The code loops through the &lt;code&gt;fetches&lt;/code&gt; (even though in this case we know there&apos;s only one) and puts the response into the cache.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;self.addEventListener(&apos;backgroundfetched&apos;, function(event) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    caches.open(&apos;downloads&apos;).then(function(cache) {\n      event.updateUI(&apos;Large file downloaded&apos;);\n      registration.showNotification(&apos;File downloaded!&apos;);\n      const promises = event.fetches.map(({ request, response }) =&amp;gt; {\n        if (response &amp;amp;&amp;amp; response.ok) {\n          return cache.put(request, response.clone());\n        }\n      });\n      return Promise.all(promises);\n    })\n  );\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, when the image is requested it will be served directly from the service worker cache, no more slow download.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on the background fetch API&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&apos;s not too hard to implement the background fetch API. There are some events I didn&apos;t implement on this initial exploration, the &lt;code&gt;backgroundfetchfail&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;backgroundfetchabort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;backgroundfetchclick&lt;/code&gt; events. In a fully featured application you would expect to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Audio difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I initially started this experiment with an audio file, but found it hard to prove I had stored the audio file successfully in the cache. I don&apos;t blame the background fetch API for this, rather the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samdutton.github.io/samples/service-worker/prefetch-video/&quot;&gt;issues in dealing with range requests in the service worker fetch event&lt;/a&gt;. Given that this API is very useful for downloading large audio and video assets for rich applications, making this easier for developers should be an important part of service worker discussions for anyone working on this feature.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Popping up in the downloads&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When testing this in Chrome on the desktop I was surprised to find that the file was downloaded in a user visible manner. My expectations were that the file would be left for the service worker to handle and cache. Instead it appeared in my downloads folder. If you were using the background fetch API to fetch resources for a game, for example, I would not expect to litter the user&apos;s downloads folder with resources that are only of use within the application. This didn&apos;t happen when I tested on an Android device though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;What UI?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the API there are places to affect the browser UI, you can set a title and icons for the fetch and update the title using the &lt;code&gt;event.updateUI&lt;/code&gt; method. However, I couldn&apos;t see this UI anywhere in my testing on desktop or mobile. I can only assume that this is being worked on and will arrive with another version of Canary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;To the future&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like to play with these early APIs, there&apos;s such a lot of potential in them (I&apos;m excited for the return of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/blog/2017/03/14/the-web-share-api/&quot;&gt;Web Share API&lt;/a&gt; too!). The background fetch API is going to be great for applications that require downloading large files or large amounts of files, with more control than just using the service worker cache. It&apos;s obviously going to be useful for video and audio applications, but games and virtual reality experiences will surely benefit from it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think there is still work to be done in browser to make this experience a good one for both developers and users, but it&apos;s exciting to see how the service worker is progressing. My next plan is to build an application that fully takes advantage of the background fetch API, as well as other service worker features, in a real world situation. Keep an eye on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/philnash/&quot;&gt;my GitHub profile&lt;/a&gt; to follow the progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re interested in the background fetch API there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/background-fetch&quot;&gt;more examples and discussion on the proposal on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Give me a shout on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you&apos;re also excited about features like this coming to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Did you know &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/a&gt; can download and install gems in parallel?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s right, using the &lt;code&gt;--jobs&lt;/code&gt; option for &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; means you can set the number of gems that can download and install at the same time. To use four jobs, for example, you can run:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle install --jobs=4\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, you don&apos;t even have to remember to use the &lt;code&gt;--jobs&lt;/code&gt; option every time. You can set this in your global bundler config with this command:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle config --global jobs 4\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Does it really help?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I found all of this out recently, even though this has been available since bundler version 1.4.0, and I wanted to test how useful it actually was. Downloading and installing gems in parallel sounds like a delight, but I needed to test it with something to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I went looking for a large Rails project to try this out on. I happened upon the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/&quot;&gt;GitLab Community Edition app&lt;/a&gt; and cloned the project. I didn&apos;t need to actually get the project running, I was just testing the installation time of the gems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking for a large application. &lt;code&gt;rake stats&lt;/code&gt; told me that it contains 172 controllers, 208 models and 86,019 lines of code. In the Gemfile there are 197 gem dependencies which shakes out to 369 gems in total. I checked out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discourse/discourse&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora&quot;&gt;Diaspora&lt;/a&gt; too, but GitLab certainly had the largest number of gems, so it was perfect to test my theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;code&gt;time bundle install --path=./gems --quiet --force --jobs=n&lt;/code&gt; five times each for n equal to 1 and 4. The median results for each were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;time bundle install --path=./gems --quiet --force --jobs=1\nreal  4m39.836s\nuser  1m59.692s\nsys 0m50.291s\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;time bundle install --path=./gems --quiet --force --jobs=4\nreal  2m55.857s\nuser  2m0.005s\nsys 0m47.897s\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These tests were run on a MacBook Pro with 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16GB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With these results we can see that installing the gems for GitLab in parallel using 4 workers was ~1.6 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You should run your own tests with your own setup to see if this genuinely will save you time with installing gems. There has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://archlever.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/lies-damned-lies-and-truths-backed-by.html&quot;&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mroth.info/blog/2014/10/02/rubygems-bundler-they-took-our-jobs/&quot;&gt;best number of jobs&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve certainly set the default number of jobs to 4 for the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Why isn&apos;t this default?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why Bundler doesn&apos;t just turn on parallel installation by default. A quick glance at the comments in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/7f1411cdb3279c25e8e8f2a8e3c1f8acf3dbe8f2/lib/bundler/installer.rb#L160-L163&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; gives this one away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# the order that the resolver provides is significant, since\n# dependencies might affect the installation of a gem.\n# that said, it&apos;s a rare situation (other than rake), and parallel\n# installation is SO MUCH FASTER. so we let people opt in.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Reading the docs&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a final point, I&apos;d like to point out that reading the documentation, even for a project you may use every day, can turn up some interesting options you didn&apos;t know you could use. Bundler itself is full of other useful commands and options, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io/v1.15/man/bundle-pristine.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle pristine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io/v1.15/man/bundle-gem.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle gem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io/v1.15/man/bundle-outdated.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle outdated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some ideas of what is available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, keep an eye out for interesting options in the software you use and go out there and install your gems faster.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a quick tip for anyone who uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv&quot;&gt;rbenv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build&quot;&gt;ruby-build&lt;/a&gt; to manage installing and switching Ruby versions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When installing a new version of Ruby I cannot think of a situation in which I wouldn&apos;t want &lt;a href=&quot;http://bundler.io/&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; installed too. The good news is that you can get rbenv to install Bundler, or any other gem you like, as soon as you install a new version of Ruby. All you need is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-default-gems&quot;&gt;default-gems&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Default gems&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you installed rbenv with &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, like me, then you can install default-gems with Homebrew too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew install rbenv-default-gems\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then you need to make a list of gems that you want installed. First create a file named &lt;code&gt;default-gems&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;$(rbenv root)&lt;/code&gt; directory. Mine is located at &lt;code&gt;~/.rbenv/default-gems&lt;/code&gt;. Add the names of the gems you want to install, one per line. You can include an optional version or the option &lt;code&gt;--pre&lt;/code&gt; for a prerelease version. For Bundler you will want the latest release, so the &lt;code&gt;default-gems&lt;/code&gt; file would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundler\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now when you install a new version of Ruby, Bundler will be installed as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/install_ruby_bundler.png&quot; alt=&quot;A terminal window shows the result of running &lt;code&gt;rbenv install 2.4.0&lt;/code&gt;. Not only is Ruby 2.4.0 installed, but so is the latest version of Bundler.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can add other gems that you always use too. If you&apos;re a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pryrepl.org/&quot;&gt;pry&lt;/a&gt;, for example, then add a line for it in &lt;code&gt;default-gems&lt;/code&gt; and you&apos;ll never have to remember to install it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;rbenv plugins&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Plugins&quot;&gt;rbenv plugins&lt;/a&gt; which you can check out, but default-gems has always been a must have for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are there any tools or plugins you use that make your Ruby development easier? I&apos;d love to hear about them! Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;share your tips with me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Recently I implemented the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/navigator-share&quot;&gt;web share API&lt;/a&gt; for my site as a means of testing it out. If you are using version 55 or above of Chrome on Android then you can see it in action by clicking &quot;share it&quot; at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t have a browser that supports the API, then this is what it looks like when you hit the share link.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;info&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Web Share API origin trial has finished and after consideration is now supported in Chrome for Android. You can keep up with support by checking out the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#search=web-share&quot;&amp;gt;Web Share API on Can I Use&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I want to share how the API works and my thoughts on it so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-left&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/webshare.png&quot; alt=&quot;A tray slides up from the bottom of the screen with sharing options from your installed applications.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The web share API is actually quite a simple API. It is available on the &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; object and consists of one method; &lt;code&gt;share&lt;/code&gt;. The method takes an object that can have &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; properties. It is mandatory to have either a &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; property, though you can have both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can only invoke &lt;code&gt;navigator.share&lt;/code&gt; as a result of a user gesture, so sites can&apos;t surprise a user into sharing a page. Also, like other powerful new web platform features, it only works on sites hosted on HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The API is Promise based, when a page is successfully shared the Promise will resolve. If the user is unable to or chooses not to share, the Promise will reject.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can feature detect the existence of the API so you can progressively enhance a site with the web share API. This is good news right now as the API is only available as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md&quot;&gt;Origin Trial&lt;/a&gt;. This means that it is not widely available and you need to opt in to testing the feature on your site. If you are on a browser that doesn&apos;t yet support the API and you click &quot;share it&quot; at the bottom of this post, you just get directed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button/web-intent&quot;&gt;Twitter web intent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Implementing the web share API&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is how you&apos;d call the web share API on its own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;navigator.share({ title: title, url: url })\n  .then(function() { console.log(&quot;Share success!&quot;); })\n  .catch(function() { console.log(&quot;Share failure!&quot;); });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And here is my first implementation of the web share API for this site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var shareLinks = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(&apos;.share&apos;));\nshareLinks.forEach(function(link) {\n  link.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;, function (event) {\n    if (typeof navigator.share !== &apos;undefined&apos;) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n      var canonicalElement = document.querySelector(&apos;link[rel=canonical]&apos;);\n      if(canonicalElement !== undefined) {\n        var url = canonicalElement.href;\n      } else {\n        var url = window.location.href;\n      }\n      var pageTitle = document.querySelector(&apos;.post-title&apos;).textContent;\n      navigator.share({ title: pageTitle, url: url })\n        .then(function() { console.log(&quot;Share success!&quot;); })\n        .catch(function() { console.log(&quot;Share failure!&quot;); });\n    } else {\n      // No web share API...\n    }\n  });\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, most of the code here is setting up listeners, feature checking and getting the actual data to share. Breaking it down, here&apos;s what happens:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Select all links with the class &quot;share&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add a &quot;click&quot; listener to each link&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When a share link is clicked, check for the existence of &lt;code&gt;navigator.share&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If it does exist, stop the link from doing anything&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Try to get the canonical URL for the page, first from the link element if it is present, otherwise from &lt;code&gt;window.location.href&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get the page title from the page&apos;s h1 element&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Share the title and url&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/philna.sh/blob/3075d51dcf723b26eaae0fa1149dd5fa3a14b03e/_assets/js/main.js#L6-L49&quot;&gt;the full code (at the time of writing) in GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on the API&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like the API and I like the benefits it brings to both developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First up it&apos;s simple to implement. One method, 3 potential arguments, Promises for success and failure. You can dig a bit deeper into it, but on the surface a developer can have this implemented in a few minutes. Hopefully this simplicity will lead to swift adoption if the API becomes a standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s more reasons I&apos;m a fan though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;User choice&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It stops host websites choosing where users can share content to. Sure, Facebook and Twitter are popular share destinations, but there are so many more apps out there that you could share content to. This long tail effect means that it is neither satisfying to only supply one or two share buttons, nor remotely sensible to make sharing everywhere possible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://platform.sharethis.com/get-inline-share-buttons&quot;&gt;ShareThis may have a bunch of share buttons available&lt;/a&gt;, but the selection still doesn&apos;t scratch the surface of possibility across the web.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a share API like this puts the control back into the users&apos; hands, allowing them to share to the applications they choose to install on their device.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Minimising JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ve seen the code above that I&apos;ve used to implement the web share API. There&apos;s not much of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s particularly small when you compare it to the scripts that popular sites supply to enable their share functionality. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/web/javascript/loading&quot;&gt;Twitter&apos;s script&lt;/a&gt; is ~32kB and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button&quot;&gt;Facebook&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; ~60kB (gzipped sizes). Best practice is to load those scripts asynchronously, so they shouldn&apos;t affect page load time. But that is a significant amount of JavaScript that needs to be loaded and parsed simply for a share button.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These scripts don&apos;t just function as the share buttons you are implementing as a developer. They allow Facebook, Twitter and the like to track their users around the web. The web share API not only gives site owners a more efficient way for users to share, but also gives back some user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Better feedback&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While it may make it harder for large social networks to track users, the web share API actually makes it easier for sites to learn about their users&apos; behaviour. As the share API works with Promises, you can find out when the share link is clicked and when a click results in a share to another application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What&apos;s missing?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Currently the thing that is missing from the implementation of the web share API is the other side of it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target&quot;&gt;The web share target API&lt;/a&gt; is an API that will allow web applications to register to appear in the share drawer when the web share API is invoked. Without the target API the web share API can only share directly to native applications available on a user&apos;s device. While this is probably still ok for those large social networks which already have applications installed on users&apos; devices, this doesn&apos;t help the long tail of potential share targets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that becoming a share target is a much more complicated process than sharing. It is a good thing that the investigation of the share API and the share target API has been split up so that we can experiment with the web share API sooner. I hope to see the web share target API trialling ideas soon though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Share away&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The web share API is currently an experiment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO0_ptFl8r8G0UFhT0xhV17eabG-erUWBDiKSRDTqEZ_9ULQ/viewform?entry.1999497328=Web+Share+(Experimenting+until+April+2017)&quot;&gt;which you can sign up to trial yourself&lt;/a&gt;) but I think it&apos;s an interesting and well meaning one. Ultimately giving users the choice over what they can share to is better for users and better for the long tail of applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think of the web share API? Let me know on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;@philnash&lt;/a&gt;.

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/blog/2017/02/09/toast-to-es2015-destructuring/&quot;&gt;I wrote a blog post last week&lt;/a&gt; and bits of it were wrong. This is not a retraction of that blog post, I just wanted to share the feedback that I got, the things I changed and some lessons that I learned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Inconsistency sucks&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first feedback I received was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/5szzfd/es2015_destructuring_promises_and_beer/&quot;&gt;posting the article on /r/javascript&lt;/a&gt;. The comment is deleted now so I can&apos;t credit the author, but they pointed out a few things:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Code styles between my two examples were different&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Two semicolons were missing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It was better to format chains of Promises by placing the &lt;code&gt;.then&lt;/code&gt; on the following line and indenting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I knew that the style of the two snippets was different as one had been written a year ago for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2016/01/day-9-service-worker-santas-little-performance-helper/&quot;&gt;12 Devs of Christmas blog&lt;/a&gt; and I had opted to retain the original code. But, mixing code styles in a project is unforgivable so why should a blog post be any different?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The formatting issues were also obvious once they had been pointed out to me. So, I went back to the post, improved the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/philna.sh/commit/9bd9af741934c5903d300c70e483d22f6de767cc&quot;&gt;Promise formatting&lt;/a&gt; and fixed both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/philna.sh/commit/707e0f9fe7724be999c3b381d34636042bc196ae&quot;&gt;semicolons and the code style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Over promising under delivers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second piece of feedback came over Twitter, firstly in a direct message from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elmasse&quot;&gt;Masse Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and then in a mention from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesDiGioia/status/830163324092481536&quot;&gt;James DiGioia&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;d gotten paranoid with my Promises and written one or two too many. I just needed to return the final data and not resolve another Promise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   const punkAPIPromise = fetch(punkAPIUrl)\n     .then(res =&amp;gt; res.json())\n-    .then(data =&amp;gt; Promise.resolve(data[0]));\n+    .then(data =&amp;gt; data[0]);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Masse and James &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/philna.sh/commit/ea38977e47e60768f430cc5a00758d44cb0d15b6&quot;&gt;I fixed that too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Accessibility matters&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing to be pointed out, and probably the most important, was not about the content of the blog post but the accessibility of my site in general. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/varjmes/status/830416813091614720&quot;&gt;James Spencer pointed out that my site failed colour contrast tests&lt;/a&gt; for both the code samples and links on the site. The tests they referred to are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html&quot;&gt;Web Content Accessibility Guidelines on colour contrast&lt;/a&gt; which recommend a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for regular body text. I learned some interesting things trying to fix this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://khan.github.io/tota11y/&quot;&gt;tota11y&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/&quot;&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;, is a really awesome tool\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I learned about it from the link James shared with me&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It suggests colours that are similar to the existing colour that would pass the test&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It also has other plugins that visualise things like out of order heading usage, poor link text, missing alt attributes and a few more, helping you to ensure your site is as accessible as possible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting themes are really bad at accessible contrast levels\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was using a version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized&quot;&gt;Solarized Dark&lt;/a&gt; which failed in a number of places&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I couldn&apos;t find any syntax highlighting theme that had decent contrast for all elements out of the box&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using syntax highlighting in your editor is one thing, you can use whichever contrast levels you are comfortable with, but on the web anyone could be reading it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I chose to use the suggestions from tota11y to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/philna.sh/commit/60201a04397ad577f7e1b37809e157d3b5309c74&quot;&gt;fix the four colours in Solarized Dark that were too low contrast&lt;/a&gt;. I also fixed my link text colour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was a little embarrassed about this because, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash/status/830421373776515074&quot;&gt;as I said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I used to be good at this sort of thing. So much so that almost 10 years ago I wrote a blog post on the very matter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unintentionallyblank.co.uk/2007/09/27/web-accessibility-colour/&quot;&gt;colour in web accessibility&lt;/a&gt;. This just goes to show that not only do we learn new things every day in web development, retaining old things is just as important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Always be improving&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I want to thank Masse, the two Jameses and the now mystery Redditor for giving me the feedback that helped to improve both my blog post and my site. If you see anything on this site that could be improved I welcome the feedback. I learned that I should keep my eye on the formatting and consistency of my code, not to over promise and to pay closer attention to accessibility concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Overall I learned that in order to always be improving—my code, my site, myself—sometimes I need to do things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment&quot;&gt;ES2015 destructuring syntax&lt;/a&gt; is pretty cool. It might not grab the headlines like Promises, Generators or the class syntax, but I find it really useful. It&apos;s also &lt;a href=&quot;http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_destructuring.html&quot;&gt;surprisingly detailed when you read into it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only shame is that most of the examples I&apos;ve found focus on just the syntax and not real life usage. Like this one from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment&quot;&gt;MDN docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var a, b;\n[a, b] = [10, 20];\nconsole.log(a); // 10\nconsole.log(b); // 20\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily I have a real life use case for destructuring for you right here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Keeping Promises&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite uses for destructuring is when using &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; to wait for a number of asynchronous tasks to complete. The result of &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; is returned as an array and you would normally iterate over it or pick out the results you need by hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you know what objects you are expecting to receive you can use parameter destructuring to make your life easier and your code both prettier and more descriptive by naming the parameters up front. Let&apos;s see an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Comparing beers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say you want to compare two of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brewdog.com/beer/headliners&quot;&gt;BrewDog&apos;s delicious beers&lt;/a&gt;, something I find myself doing in real life &lt;a href=&quot;https://untappd.com/user/philnash&quot;&gt;all the time&lt;/a&gt;. We can get the information about them from Sam Mason&apos;s gloriously named &lt;a href=&quot;https://punkapi.com/&quot;&gt;Punk API&lt;/a&gt;. To implement this we use the &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; API to get the data on each beer from the API. We need both requests to resolve before we can compare the beers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s take a look at the code:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  const punkAPIUrl = &quot;https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers/106&quot;;\n  const deadPonyClubUrl = &quot;https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers/91&quot;;\n  const punkAPIPromise = fetch(punkAPIUrl)\n    .then(res =&amp;gt; res.json())\n    .then(data =&amp;gt; data[0]);\n  const deadPonyClubPromise = fetch(deadPonyClubUrl)\n    .then(res =&amp;gt; res.json())\n    .then(data =&amp;gt; data[0]);\n\n  Promise.all([punkAPIPromise, deadPonyClubPromise])\n    .then(beers =&amp;gt; {\n      const punkIPA = beers[0];\n      const deadPonyClub = beers[1];\n      const stronger = (punkIPA.abv &amp;lt; deadPonyClub.abv ? deadPonyClub.name : punkIPA.name) + &quot; is stronger&quot;;\n      console.log(stronger);\n    });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can tidy that Promise up with parameter destructuring:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Promise.all([punkAPIPromise, deadPonyClubPromise])\n    .then(([punkIPA, deadPonyClub]) =&amp;gt; {\n      const stronger = (punkIPA.abv &amp;lt; deadPonyClub.abv ? deadPonyClub.name : punkIPA.name) + &quot; is stronger&quot;;\n      console.log(stronger);\n    });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We know we&apos;re getting two beers as a result and the way this example is constructed we even know which beer is which. So we can use the parameter destructuring to name the beers in the array instead of plucking them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;More examples&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, this may still seem like a made up example, but it certainly is closer to real life. The first time I found myself using this technique was when writing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2016/01/day-9-service-worker-santas-little-performance-helper/&quot;&gt;Service Workers for 12 Devs of Christmas&lt;/a&gt;. It came in handy when writing the method &lt;code&gt;returnFromCacheOrFetch&lt;/code&gt; which implements the &quot;stale while revalidate&quot; caching method using the &lt;code&gt;caches&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; APIs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The method opens up a named cache and tries to match the current request against the cache. Before returning, it then kicks off a &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; request for the requested resource, caching the result. Finally if the request was found in the cache the cached response is returned, otherwise the new fetch request is returned. You can read more about it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2016/01/day-9-service-worker-santas-little-performance-helper/&quot;&gt;the original blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The final code looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function returnFromCacheOrFetch(request, cacheName) {\n  const cachePromise = caches.open(cacheName);\n  const matchPromise = cachePromise\n    .then((cache) =&amp;gt; cache.match(request));\n\n  // Use the result of both the above Promises to return the Response. Promise.all returns an array, but we destructure that in the callback.\n  return Promise.all([cachePromise, matchPromise])\n    .then(([cache, cacheResponse]) =&amp;gt; {\n      // Kick off the update request\n      const fetchPromise = fetch(request)\n        .then((fetchResponse) =&amp;gt; {\n          // Cache the updated file and then return the response\n          cache.put(request, fetchResponse.clone());\n          return fetchResponse;\n        });\n      // return the cached response if we have it, otherwise the result of the fetch.\n      return cacheResponse || fetchPromise;\n    });\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this case I needed both the result of &lt;code&gt;caches.open&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cache.match(request)&lt;/code&gt; in order to perform the background fetch and return the cached response. I drew them together using &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; and destructured the resulting array keeping the code tidy and descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Naming things&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In these examples, parameter destructuring allows us to name the results we expect to get from the resolved Promises we pass to &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, anywhere we use parameter destructuring, particularly with arrays, it allows us to name objects early and more descriptively. This in turn makes the code more readable and more maintainable in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are there other places in your code that you&apos;ve found the ES2015 destructuring syntax helpful? I&apos;d love to know how you use the feature too, so please share your destructuring tips with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "On fixing a favicon"
    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Sometimes open source work is just fixing one tiny thing that bugs you. However, rolling up your sleeves and delving into even the smallest amount of code can lead to surprising results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I fixed a favicon recently. Here&apos;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I fixed something for me&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least, fixing this issue has made me happier. The problem was that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.20.5/&quot;&gt;Crystal standard library documentation&lt;/a&gt; wasn&apos;t showing a favicon, so when I had a bunch of tabs open in my browser I couldn&apos;t tell which ones had the Crystal docs I was using.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I fixed something for someone else&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a guess, but if I found this an issue then we can presume at least one other person out there on the internet did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I learned more about favicons&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was the bit I didn&apos;t expect. I&apos;ve built websites for a long time now, I thought I knew all there was to know about favicons. How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started by making a mistake. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/3832&quot;&gt;original pull request was against the Crystal project itself&lt;/a&gt; and added &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the documentation&apos;s HTML layout. This would make it dependent on the structure of the Crystal website though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feedback lead me to try again. This time I wanted to make the favicon for the Crystal website work by default for any pages situated on the crystal-lang.org domain, including the docs. This lead to a bunch of discoveries about favicons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you have a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for both a &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;.ico&lt;/code&gt; favicon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathantneal.com/blog/understand-the-favicon/&quot;&gt;Chrome and Safari will always pick the &lt;code&gt;.ico&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Firefox will always pick the &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer only started supporting &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; favicons since version 11&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to use a high quality &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; favicon and a fallback for old Internet Explorer then the best course of action is to include a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; icon in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and place the &lt;code&gt;.ico&lt;/code&gt; version in the default location: &lt;code&gt;/favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt;. This way Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE11/Edge will all choose the &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; icon and old Internet Explorer will ignore the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and look for &lt;code&gt;/favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, as with anything on the web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet&quot;&gt;there is even more to it than that&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-website/pull/15/files&quot;&gt;my resulting pull request&lt;/a&gt; and it was merged. Now favicons work on the documentation as well as the main site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I learned more about the Crystal project&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my early pull request I learned about how the Crystal standard library documentation is generated and rendered. Then, when exploring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-website&quot;&gt;Crystal website&lt;/a&gt; I found that not only is it currently built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; but that there was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-website/issues/12&quot;&gt;open issue&lt;/a&gt; pointing to my blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://philna.sh/blog/2016/06/28/asset-pipelines-with-jekyll-assets/&quot;&gt;using Jekyll Assets to build an asset pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. If there was one thing in the world that I was definitely capable of it was using my own blog post to make caching assets better. So I rolled up my sleeves and prepared &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-website/pull/16&quot;&gt;another pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I am more familiar with the Crystal website and the team behind it that have commented on, reviewed and merged my pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The simplest piece of work can lead you anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to make favicons work yet it lead to 3 pull requests, a rabbit hole of discovery about favicons and browsers and the motivation to write a blog post about it. Ultimately, I did get what I wanted in the first place though: more recognisable tabs when I&apos;m working with Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open source is a lot of things to a lot of people. To me, it&apos;s a way to learn while I help, however small the task may seem. I&apos;d love for you to share with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&gt;me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; what open source means to you.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Browser dev tools are so full of features it&apos;s hard to keep up. I bet every developer knows a different set of features to each other. I wanted to share a few little tips that I use, that you might not know and that if I don&apos;t write down I might forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Read on and discover the magic of &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;temp0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Access selected elements as variables&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you&apos;re clicking around the Inspector in Firefox or the Elements tab in Chrome and you want to use the selected element in the console, you need a reference to that element. You could type out a &lt;code&gt;querySelector&lt;/code&gt; that would pick the element out of the document, but that&apos;s far too much work. Instead, leave the element selected and use &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; in the console to get the reference you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/dev-tools-tricks/firefox-dollar-zero.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typing $0 in the Firefox dev tools console will grab a reference to the currently selected element.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/picture&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chrome even hints at this by showing &lt;code&gt;== $0&lt;/code&gt; next to the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/dev-tools-tricks/chrome-dollar-zero.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typing $0 in the Chrome dev tools console will grab a reference to the currently selected element.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Be aware though, if you select a different element in the inspector then it will become the subject of &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; and you will lose the reference to the old one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Firefox has another trick for this. Right click on an element and choose &quot;Use in console&quot;. This places a variable called &lt;code&gt;temp0&lt;/code&gt; into the console&apos;s command line which is a reference to that selected element.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/dev-tools-tricks/firefox-use-in-console.png&quot; alt=&quot;In Firefox you can right click on an element and choose &apos;Use in console&apos; to use it in the console as a variable named temp0.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Turn any object in the console into a global variable&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re dealing with other objects in the console, perhaps something you&apos;ve logged from your own code, and you want to reference them then there are a couple of ways to do that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt;, for example, is a reference to the last object that was returned in the console.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/dev-tools-tricks/firefox-dollar-underscore&quot; alt=&quot;Typing $_ in the dev tools console will grab a reference to the last returned object in the console.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More generally, any object that has been returned or logged to the console can be turned into a global variable by right clicking on it and selecting &quot;Store as global variable&quot;. You will get a variable called &lt;code&gt;temp0&lt;/code&gt; which references that object. Even better, do it for more objects and you&apos;ll get new variables called &lt;code&gt;temp1&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;temp2&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/dev-tools-tricks/store-as-global.png&quot; alt=&quot;Right click on any object in the console and choose &apos;Store as global object&apos; to save it as a variable.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/picture&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Dev tools go deep&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is so much to learn about dev tools, these are just a few little tricks that might help when debugging your code.

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Git may be the best version control software I&apos;ve used but it is a complex beast and makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot. Recently, however, I learned of one way that you can unshoot yourself and potentially save yourself hours of lost work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-left&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xkcd.com/1597/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png&quot; alt=&quot;XKCD&apos;s take on Git, in brief it is about memorising a bunch of commands to use and deleting everything if you mess up.&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset&lt;/code&gt; is useful when you&apos;ve done something wrong. You can turn back the clock and undo commits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset --soft HEAD~1&lt;/code&gt; undoes one commit and leaves the work from that commit still present in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset --hard HEAD~1&lt;/code&gt; removes the commit and all the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The difference between the &lt;code&gt;--soft&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--hard&lt;/code&gt; flag is one of those ways you can shoot yourself in the foot. I know I&apos;ve mixed the two up and lost work. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Enter the reflog&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that git is watching us closer than we may think. When we make changes to any branch, git stores those changes in the reflog. Even if we were to remove a whole bunch of work by resetting with the &lt;code&gt;--hard&lt;/code&gt; flag, git still knows about the commits we had made and we can recover them. The key is that the commits still exist, there just aren&apos;t any branches that currently point to them. This is where the reflog comes into play. It has a log of all commits made in the repo, as well as other actions, and we can use it to recover these lost commits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Warning!&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Before I show you how this works, please note the following. If you have uncommitted changes in the working directory and you use &lt;code&gt;git reset --hard&lt;/code&gt; no amount of fancy git knowledge about the reflog is going to get that back. The following will save only work that you have committed. Be warned!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How to use the reflog to recover lost commits&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s an example, I have a repo with one commit. Running &lt;code&gt;git log --oneline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git reflog&lt;/code&gt; both show the commit has the hash &lt;code&gt;2daf3ba&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/reflog1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Both log and reflog show the same initial commit.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we make a commit, something important of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/reflog2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Making an important commit adds another entry to both the log and the reflog.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What happens if we &lt;code&gt;git reset --hard HEAD~1&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/reflog3.png&quot; alt=&quot;When we hard reset the branch the log shows only our first commit, but the reflog shows everything.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; shows only one commit, but &lt;code&gt;git reflog&lt;/code&gt; shows three actions; two commits and one reset. Note how the reset points to the same hash as the original commit. So, how do we get back to the last state before we reset? We can reset again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/reflog4.png&quot; alt=&quot;We can reset the branch using the hash of the lost commit, the log then shows both our original commits.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This time we reset using the hash of our lost commit. You can always reset using hashes, in fact &lt;code&gt;HEAD~1&lt;/code&gt; is really just a reference to a hash. What does the reflog look like now?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure class=&quot;post-image post-image-outside&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/reflog5.png&quot; alt=&quot;The reflog now shows the four actions  that were taken; two commits and then two resets.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The reflog now shows the four actions that we took; two commits and then two resets. Now we have reset the branch to the state we were in before, no work has been lost, breathe a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;May you never lose your work again&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The git reflog keeps a track of everything we get up to with git. As with most things in git once you learn about the feature you can use it to your advantage. Knowing I have this trick up my sleeve has made me more confident using git.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tarkasteve&quot;&gt;Steve Smith&lt;/a&gt; for the talk he gave at &lt;a href=&quot;http://berlin2016.codemotionworld.com/&quot;&gt;Codemotion Berlin&lt;/a&gt; where I learned this trick. There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://voicerepublic.com/talks/knowledge-is-power&quot;&gt;audio recording of his talk available&lt;/a&gt; and a much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/refs-and-the-reflog/the-reflog&quot;&gt;more detailed article about git refs and the reflog on Atlassian&apos;s tutorial site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you need more tips for escaping from nightmare git scenarios, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://ohshitgit.com/&quot;&gt;Oh shit, git!&lt;/a&gt; a collection of git tips from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ksylor&quot;&gt;Katie Sylor-Miller&lt;/a&gt;. She calls the reflog a magic time machine, I certainly agree and hopefully now you do too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;small&amp;gt;Git logo by &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonlong&quot;&amp;gt;Jason Long&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/small&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Last week I was blown away by the response to a problem I was experiencing from maintainers of two of the larger open source projects in the Ruby world. And not just your average large Ruby projects, but implementations of Ruby itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I had &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/philnash/envyable/builds/156080057&quot;&gt;trouble running the tests&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/envyable&quot;&gt;envyable&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/02/managing-development-environment-variables-across-multiple-ruby-applications.html&quot;&gt;gem to manage environment variables in your projects&lt;/a&gt;, on Rubinius on TravisCI. After installing the version of Rubinius locally, I couldn&apos;t reproduce the issue. So I tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;Anyone seen this error on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/travisci&quot;&amp;gt;@travisci&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codeclimate&quot;&amp;gt;@codeclimate&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; coverage on &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rubinius&quot;&amp;gt;@rubinius&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;? &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fydiHoElCa&quot;&amp;gt;https://t.co/fydiHoElCa&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubinius/envyable/commit/fe574af226021f278b36f77278de3ad57768d7b2&quot;&gt;forked the project and tried to get it working himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&amp;gt;@philnash&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; you&apos;re using an ancient version 3.29.

I followed his advice but eventually had to settle with moving Rubinius to the allowed failures list in my TravisCI config. I&apos;m still working with the TravisCI support team to try to fix the issue. We&apos;re getting there as it turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-rubies/commit/308d29198f0eeec87bf10d9110eb1df45c7dbb13&quot;&gt;TravisCI was looking in the wrong place for the latest Rubinius binaries&lt;/a&gt;. That issue is fixed but I am now getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/philnash/envyable/builds/157463309&quot;&gt;timeouts for my builds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This affected &lt;a href=&quot;http://jruby.org/&quot;&gt;JRuby&lt;/a&gt; too and when I mentioned that on Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/headius&quot;&gt;Charles Nutter&lt;/a&gt; from the JRuby core team also offered to help out if it was a JRuby bug.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/philnash&quot;&amp;gt;@philnash&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/travisci&quot;&amp;gt;@travisci&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rubinius&quot;&amp;gt;@rubinius&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; That JRuby failure looks like a timeout installing the base gemset in rvm.

Not by a long way. The issues are also likely not with Rubinius or JRuby. But the willingness for Brian and Charles to reach out to help was amazing. I&apos;m sure they are very busy people and just the response was appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So thank you Brian and thank you Charles. Thank you for your work in the Ruby community and thank you specifically for offering your help to me. Acts like this maintain my belief in the power and the strength of the Ruby community.&lt;/p&gt;"

    },
    "description": {
      "value": "&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s been some interesting updates in service workers recently. The big news is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghacks.net/2016/08/14/microsoft-edge-improves-on-windows-10-14901/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Edge development version now has service workers, alongside push notifications and background sync, behind flags&lt;/a&gt;. There was a new feature that caught my eye though; a declarative method for registering service workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Up until now, to register a service worker, you need to write JavaScript. It would look something like this (emoji logging optional):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;\n  if (&apos;serviceWorker&apos; in navigator) {\n    navigator.serviceWorker.register(&quot;/sw.js&quot;, { scope: &quot;/blog/&quot; })\n      .then(function(registration) { console.log(&quot;🍻&quot;); })\n      .catch(function(error) { console.log(&quot;😭&quot;, error); });\n  }\n&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you allow the service worker lifecycle to play out naturally and you&apos;re not using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/02/web-powered-sms-inbox-with-service-worker-push-notifications.html&quot;&gt;push notifications&lt;/a&gt; or background sync then this is all you need. New in Chrome 54 (currently Canary) there is an experiment to make this even simpler, more declarative, with the use of a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the HTML or via a &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve put together a quick example repository showing all three approaches which you can use to install a service worker. There&apos;s the JavaScript way, as seen above. Or, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/install-service-worker/blob/master/public/link/index.html#L5&quot;&gt;you can just use a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt;, like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;serviceworker&quot; href=&quot;/sw.js&quot; scope=&quot;/blog/&quot;&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/install-service-worker/blob/master/index.js#L5&quot;&gt;install the service worker with an HTTP header&lt;/a&gt; that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Link: &amp;lt;/sw.js&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;serviceworker&quot;; scope=&quot;/blog/&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each of these methods will install the service worker file &lt;code&gt;/sw.js&lt;/code&gt; with the scope &lt;code&gt;&quot;/blog/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. I&apos;ve produced an example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/install-service-worker&quot;&gt;how you&apos;d use these methods to install a service worker on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to enable &quot;Experimental Web Platform features&quot; in Chrome Canary before you try it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Foreign fetch&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these alternative ways to register a service worker stem from the foreign fetch proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you have a service worker registered it can respond to any fetch request made from a page under its control. Foreign fetch intends to make it possible to register a service worker and respond to cross origin requests. You can read more about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/master/foreign_fetch_explainer.md&quot;&gt;foreign fetch proposal in the spec on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. The take away for me was that foreign fetch will make it more robust to rely on third party APIs that you call from the browser in our web apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, cross origin requests for resources like an API won&apos;t be running your regular JavaScript that would install your service worker. This is where the &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; header comes in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The service worker revolution marches on&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether it&apos;s new developments in browsers that already support service workers or new browsers joining the fold (come on Safari…), I continue to be excited about the potential this technology is bringing to our web applications. I particularly like simplifications to the process and installing a service worker with just a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag appeals to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to catch me speaking about my excitement for service workers I&apos;ll be doing so all over Europe this Autumn. Look out for me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendconf.ch/speakers/#phil-nash&quot;&gt;Frontend Conference Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://refresh.rocks/speakers#phil&quot;&gt;Refresh in Tallinn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://devday.pl/&quot;&gt;DevDay in Kraków&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;June saw me &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/06/20/critique-my-swift-on-exercism/&quot;&gt;ask for your help&lt;/a&gt; as I started to learn Swift. July was busy with travel. Now August is iOS month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m lucky that part of my job as a developer evangelist for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt; is to learn new things. That is why I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes/ios-essentials-with-swift&quot;&gt;Big Nerd Ranch Swift and iOS course&lt;/a&gt; in June and is what has lead me to dedicate August to building my first iOS application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;My first app&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By first application, I really mean my first one that I am going to take from beginning to end, from blank Xcode project to the App Store, all by myself. I have worked on iOS applications before. I remember a time when I managed to crash an iPad app so badly while working on it, that checking out the previous version of the app still lead to crashes in the feature that I&apos;d spent too long looking at. I did not receive too many more tasks to complete on that application. But those were the days of memory managed Objective C and working in a team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, with my newly gained knowledge of Swift, it&apos;s just me, Xcode and a month of clear space to build something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/new_xcode_project.png&quot; alt=&quot;The view of Xcode when you start a new project.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;2,000,000 applications&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the question one always lands on is what that something should be. This is my first application and a solo effort at that, so I&apos;m looking for something with a constrained scope, something that will be achievable this month, something that will be achievable by me. When I remembered that Apple announced at WWDC this year that the App Store now had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11922926/apple-apps-2-million-wwdc-2016&quot;&gt;more than 2 million applications available to download&lt;/a&gt; I realised that I&apos;m not looking for a brand new idea. Anything that can be built by a novice developer within a month has almost certainly already been built.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I decided the best idea would be to tackle something I have done before in a different environment. As it happens, I own &lt;a href=&quot;http://fxrat.es/&quot;&gt;fxrat.es&lt;/a&gt;, the world&apos;s least popular exchange rate calculator. It&apos;s best feature is not up to the minute exchange rate data, but that it works offline in modern browsers. It&apos;s a web application I wanted to use myself when abroad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;New and improved&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about rewriting it for a couple of reasons. Firstly, sometimes it just doesn&apos;t work and I&apos;ve never found out why. Secondly, it currently works offline using the web platform&apos;s Application Cache. The AppCache is going away, &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag&quot;&gt;for good reasons&lt;/a&gt;, so it is time to update to use my new favourite browser feature, the Service Worker. However that will not work in Safari.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to me like a good opportunity to both rewrite my existing application for the web and produce a new, offline capable native application for iOS that I can release in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The task is set&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So that is August for me. Buried in Xcode creating a new application. Wish me luck and follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philnash/fxrates-ios&quot;&gt;my progress on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;See you in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;When I started again on this site, I wanted to make sure it was going to load fast. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23perfmatters&quot;&gt;Performance matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bundling, minifying and caching the static assets was high on the priority list. The site is built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; so I went looking for (and ultimately found) a plugin that would perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bundle static files together&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Minify the resulting files&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate a hash of the content of the file as the production filename (&lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark&quot;&gt;the Rails documentation has a good explanation of this fingerprinting technique&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Can&apos;t Jekyll do this?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jekyll 3 can handle the bundling and minification of CSS. In fact, Jekyll comes with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt; included which actually does the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you start a new Jekyll site, you will find a &lt;code&gt;css&lt;/code&gt; directory with a &lt;code&gt;main.css&lt;/code&gt; file present. That file then uses Sass imports to require other files from the &lt;code&gt;_sass&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s bundling handled already, how about minification? It takes one config update to enable that too. Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sass:\n  style: compressed\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Jekyll-Assets for all the features&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re hosting a Jekyll site on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; this is as good as it gets. You can&apos;t install other Jekyll plugins and GitHub handles the caching headers for your static files.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But what if you have your own server and want more control? What if you want those fingerprints so that you can set your own cache headers far into the future? What if you want to provide your own transpilers, processors or minifiers?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the features I wanted. So I did a bit of research and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-assets/&quot;&gt;Jekyll-Assets&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s a pretty powerful plugin, with lots of features for optimising assets. Here&apos;s how you can get started using it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Getting started with Jekyll-Assets&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;info&quot;&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This blog post was written for Jekyll Assets version 2.4.0. Jekyll Assets version 3 has now been released and changes a few things, if you are using Jekyll Assets 3 the following may not apply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s set up Jekyll-Assets for a Jekyll site. First up, we need to install the jekyll-assets gem. Add it to the &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem &quot;jekyll-assets&quot;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and install with &lt;code&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;. Then add it to the &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gems:\n  - jekyll-paginate\n  - jekyll-assets\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jekyll-Assets comes with a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets/wiki/Configuration#development-defaults&quot;&gt;default config&lt;/a&gt; to make it quick to get started, so we don&apos;t need to change that right now. We do need to move a couple of files about though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we saw earlier, Jekyll comes with a &lt;code&gt;css&lt;/code&gt; directory containing a &lt;code&gt;main.css&lt;/code&gt; file and then a &lt;code&gt;_sass&lt;/code&gt; directory with a few Sass imports. We want to move them all to the &lt;code&gt;_assets/css&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir -p _assets/css\n$ mv css/main.css _assets/css\n$ mv _sass/* _assets/css\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jekyll includes some empty &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;main.css&lt;/code&gt;. We need to get rid of that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---\n# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)\n---\n@charset &quot;utf-8&quot;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It may &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; that the main Sass file needs front matter but with Jekyll-Assets that is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Fixing up the HTML&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CSS is now no longer where the layout thinks it should be. We need to update the &lt;code&gt;_includes/head.html&lt;/code&gt; to point to our new CSS file. As we are going to be generating unique filenames for our assets in production we need to use the Jekyll-Assets supplied liquid tags to fill them in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;code&gt;_includes/head.html&lt;/code&gt; and replace the existing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ &quot;{% css main &quot; }}%}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the filename digests working a quick config change is all you need. Open up &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; and add:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;assets:\n  digest: true\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start the Jekyll development server with &lt;code&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; and open up &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;. The site will be displaying as you expect and if you view source you will see the generated &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag looking a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/assets/main-daf4744048a36abfd0aae160e2f7c309c4ae468f16d65e77d89c70fc8d7ba6ec.css&quot;&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our digests are working! You can turn this off in development mode, Jekyll-Assets will generate digests, as well as bundle and minify, by default in production mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Other assets&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want other assets to get the Jekyll-Assets treatment, all you need to do is move them to their respective directory in &lt;code&gt;_assets&lt;/code&gt; and refer to them using the relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-assets/#tags&quot;&gt;liquid tags&lt;/a&gt;. The default available directories include &lt;code&gt;_assets/images&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_assets/js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;On the server&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The entire purpose of adding Jekyll-Assets to my site was to set cache headers way into the future so that browsers can cache the assets as aggressively as they can. The easiest part of this turned out to be adding the config to my web server. I&apos;m using nginx and all I needed was:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;server {\n  # other config\n\n  location /assets/ {\n    expires 1y;\n    add_header Cache-Control &quot;public&quot;;\n  }\n\n  # ...\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Bundled, minified, digested, cached&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using the Jekyll-Assets gem and a bit of nginx config I optimised the static assets on this site. There are loads more options for the gem including integrations with Babel for ES2015, CSS Autoprefixer and Image Magick for image optimisation. It is worth exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets&quot;&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-assets/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to see what else can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now my assets are nicely optimised it&apos;s more fun to run &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webpagetest.org/&quot;&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/a&gt; against the site. Looks like I better start looking into CDN options now. Thankfully Jekyll-Assets supports those too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;*[CDN]: Content Delivery Network\n*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets\n*[ES2015]: ECMAScript 2015\n*[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language&lt;/p&gt;"

      "value": "&lt;p&gt;Building up and sending an Ajax request is so much easier than it ever used to be. No longer must we hassle ourselves with &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, never mind the horror of ActiveX&apos;s &lt;code&gt;ActiveXObject(&quot;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch&quot;&gt;Fetch API&lt;/a&gt; is here (and it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/fetch&quot;&gt;polyfilled&lt;/a&gt; for older browsers). Then there&apos;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/a&gt; that makes building up and submitting form data really easy, especially compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#A_little_vanilla_framework&quot;&gt;the 130 or so lines of JavaScript you&apos;d need to do it yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But you can still get things wrong. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can definitely get things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to write about what I got wrong to remind myself for the future. My mistakes involved the Fetch API, &lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt; and a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; server in Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;I couldn&apos;t POST any data&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was simple, I wanted to POST some data to my server. I had Express set up, I&apos;d installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser&quot;&gt;body-parser&lt;/a&gt; (normally something I forget to do until this kind of problem comes along), I had a route that was ready to receive my data and do something with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It looked a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const Express = require(&quot;express&quot;);\nconst bodyParser = require(&quot;body-parser&quot;);\n\nconst app = new Express();\n\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n\napp.post(&quot;/&quot;, function(request, response) {\n  console.log(request.body.foo);\n  response.send(&quot;OK&quot;);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(&quot;Application is listening on localhost:3000&quot;);\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OK, it was more complicated than that, but that&apos;s all we need to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The front end was going to be even easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var formData = new FormData();\nformData.append(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);\nfetch(&quot;/&quot;, {\n  method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n  body: formData\n}).then(function(response) {\n  // Yay!\n}).catch(function(err) {\n  // Boo!\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The plan was simple: run the server, run the front end code, see &quot;bar&quot; printed in the console, celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;img src=&quot;/posts/formdata/undefined.png&quot; alt=alt=&apos;The console logged out &quot;undefined&quot;&apos; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, the JavaScript developer&apos;s worst enemy (aside from perhaps callback hell and developers from other languages telling them that they&apos;re doing it wrong).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I searched up and down the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object, looking for that simple piece of data that I had sent. I checked in all the places I thought it might be &lt;code&gt;request.body&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;request.params&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;request.query&lt;/code&gt;, Express has all of those you know. I checked in plenty of places I didn&apos;t think it would be. Finally I did what any sensible developer would do. I asked the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The internet is a wonderful support network&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love that out there is a resource where I can ask questions and people respond and help me. The internet came up trumps in this case, I asked and many people chimed in with ways to fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first solution was to set the content type to JSON and just send JSON to the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var data = { foo: &quot;bar&quot; };\nfetch(&quot;/&quot;, {\n  method: &quot;POST&quot;,\n  body: JSON.stringify(data),\n  headers: {\n    &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;\n  }\n}).then(function(response) {\n  // Yay!\n}).catch(function(err) {\n  // Boo!\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This worked, but I was confused. I had this really easy &lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt; object to work with, but the solution was to throw it away and use &lt;code&gt;JSON.stringify&lt;/code&gt;? It didn&apos;t seem right. It worked but I wanted to persist and make it work the way I had intended.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;It works in Rails&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edds&quot;&gt;Edd&lt;/a&gt; sorted me out. Firstly he said that my front end JavaScript wasn&apos;t wrong, the same code worked with a Rails back end. I think that put him on the route to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36918287/cant-post-data-using-javascript-fetch-api&quot;&gt;the correct answer&lt;/a&gt; though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out that body-parser doesn&apos;t understand &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt; encoded forms (though as Edd pointed out, &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#uploading-files&quot;&gt;Rails does&lt;/a&gt;). And &lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt;, when added to a Fetch API request (or an &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; as it happens, I checked), will set the content type to &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt;. It actually says that right here in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects&quot;&gt;first paragraph of the MDN documentation&lt;/a&gt;. In bold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like to say that &quot;people don&apos;t read things on the internet&quot;. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don&apos;t read things on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my defence, I would have thought that body-parser might parse the body of the request. Once again skimming over the documentation was my downfall. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser#readme&quot;&gt;line 2 of the body-parser readme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the body-parser readme doesn&apos;t just say that it won&apos;t handle &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt; bodies, it even goes as far as suggesting other modules to use for those requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable#readme&quot;&gt;formidable&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-formidable&quot;&gt;express-formidable middleware&lt;/a&gt;. Our example server now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const Express = require(&quot;express&quot;);\nconst bodyParser = require(&quot;body-parser&quot;);\nconst formidable = require(&quot;express-formidable&quot;);\n\nconst app = new Express();\n\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\napp.use(formidable());\n\napp.post(&quot;/&quot;, function(request, response) {\n  console.log(request.fields.foo)\n  response.send(&quot;OK&quot;);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(&quot;Application is listening on localhost:3000&quot;);\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt; objects set the content type of a Fetch API (or &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;) request to &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt; automagically.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;body-parser doesn&apos;t support parsing the body of a &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt; request. But there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.org/package/busboy#readme&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.org/package/multiparty#readme&quot;&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.org/package/formidable#readme&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.org/package/multer#readme&quot;&gt;do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The internet is a very helpful place. Thank you to Edd and others who suggested what I might be doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;READ THE DOCUMENTATION. Then probably read it again just to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;There are no surprises&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are actually very few surprises in development, particularly when using modern browser APIs and well supported frameworks and reading the documentation. I learned quite a bit from this one small episode as you can see above. The next thing I need to do is write some documentation for someone else. Eventually, they&apos;ll read it and be thankful as I was.&lt;/p&gt;"

a few font variations. 13 configurable axes shouldn't be needed at all times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tobestobs/status/1647322057980485633\" style=\"--image-url:

Does the removal of font axes affect the font size? Let's find out!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/source-foundry/Slice\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsource-foundry%2FSlice')\">Slice is an open-source application to create custom font design spaces from variable fonts</a>. Unfortunately, I'm not enough font nerd to understand all of Slice's functionality, but what I get is that you can inspect a font's axes and limit their ranges or define a static value for each.</p>\n<p>\n      <div class=\"sqip-container margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n        <figure class=\"sqip-image\" style=\"\n          --color1: rgb(52,124,188); --color2: rgb(93,138,180);

I couldn't find any recent stats to answer this question, but if my memory doesn't fail me, it's only a tiny fraction of the overall web traffic (below 1%).</p>\n<p>And that's no surprise. Have you tried using the web without JS? If so, I doubt you've come very far. JavaScript drives everything from small widgets and form validation to full-fledged all-in JS sites.</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox info margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-info\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <p>Keep in mind that disabled JavaScript is not the primary reason why applications break. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement#do-not-assume-users-turn-off-css-or-javascript\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fservice-manual%2Ftechnology%2Fusing-progressive-enhancement%23do-not-assume-users-turn-off-css-or-javascript')\">As the friends at GOV.UK rightfully say</a> there are plenty of reasons why JavaScript fails. A browser extension could block it, the visitor might be on a flaky network, there could be a DNS issue, ... the possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>That's why <strong>progressive enhancement should be at the core of your web development</strong>.</p>\n</div><p>But still, if you want to be a good web citizen, you should inform people that your site requires enabled scripting. How can you do this?</p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noscript\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FHTML%2FElement%2Fnoscript')\">the <code>noscript</code> element</a>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>noscript</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>This page requires JavaScript<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>noscript</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>noscript</code> element works fine but, unfortunately, is an HTML-only solution. You can't adjust your styles when JavaScript is disabled. But how could you detect if scripts run in CSS?</p>\n<p>To detect if JavaScript is enabled, you can deliver your HTML with a <code>no-js</code> class that will be removed via JavaScript. When your JS runs, you can then style your page depending on the existing or removed <code>no-js</code> class.</p>\n<p>This approach always felt hacky to me, though. And there's news! Today I learned about <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#scripting\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fmediaqueries-5%2F%23scripting')\">the Media Queries Level 5 spec that defines a <code>scripting</code> media feature</a>.</p>\n<pre

Queries</a>.</p>\n<p>Orientation queries might be the solution to a niche problem, but I think it's exciting and makes a nice demo.</p>\n<p>[Interactive component: visit the article to see it...]</p>\n<p>The CSS to make this work is as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.container</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">container-type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> size<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">height</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 12rem<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@container</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token property\">orientation</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> portrait<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token selector\">.portrait</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">display</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> grid<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token selector\">.landscape</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">display</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> none<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Building this component took me surprisingly long because orientation queries have a big gotcha. If you want to evaluate a container's orientation, you must consider the inline and(!) block size and define <code>container-type: size</code>. And this is where it becomes tricky for browser makers. How would you implement a container query that depends on X and Y axis with the dynamic nature of CSS? I've no idea.</p>\n<p>So currently, you have to set an explicit <code>height</code> in all major browsers (Chromium, Safari, Firefox), or your container has zero height if you want to consider both axes in your queries. Badumpts... Container queries and browsers are complicated.</p>\n<p>In summary, this functionality makes a fancy demo, but it's hard for me to find a use case for a <code>orienation: portrait</code> when I have to define the component height myself. But hey – today I learned. 😅</p>\n</div>\n\n          <hr>\n          <a href=\"mailto:stefanjudis@gmail.com?subject=Re%3A%20Size container queries can detect landscape / portrait orientation\">\n            Reply to Stefan\n          </a>\n        ",

Netlify sponsors <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.11ty.dev%2F')\">11ty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.solidjs.com/\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.solidjs.com%2F')\">Solid</a> development and even bought Gatsby.</p>\n<p>Vercel, on the other hand, obviously develops Next.js, but also hired Svelte lead developer Rich Harris.</p>\n<p>Everybody tries to be friends with the framework folks. And that's no surprise – if a trending framework recommends a hoster, chances are high that users will try things out there. No complicated math here... 🤷‍♂️</p>\n<p><strong>But what if independent Frameworks stop recommending but start integrating with their favorite hosting provider?</strong> Sounds wild? Well, that's what we see with Next. Sure, it's Vercel's framework, so it's fair game that it works best when deployed on their infrastructure.</p>\n<p>But what will happen with all these independent frameworks? If hosting recommendations become infra integrations, choosing a framework means choosing a hoster.</p>\n<p>And what about the idea of having Frontend code that runs everywhere? Is it time to let this idea go?</p>\n<p>With Next, it's already tricky. Initiatives like <a href=\"https://open-next.js.org/\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fopen-next.js.org%2F')\">Open Next</a> try to make the compiled output work on different providers, and Netlify <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/next-runtime\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnetlify%2Fnext-runtime')\">plays catch-up with their Next runtime</a>. But Vercel leads the way, and Next simply works best on their infra.</p>\n<p>\n      <div class=\"sqip-container margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n        <figure class=\"sqip-image\" style=\"\n          --color1: rgb(48,82,126);

Guess what happened after releasing the rebuilt site?</p>\n<p>Within a day, a furious gallery owner told me I had broken Google. What? Google doesn't work anymore? What happened? Well... I didn't care about the URLs and changed everything to WordPress's default schema.</p>\n<p>The lesson: <strong>Cool URIs don't change</strong>. And I've just read <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FProvider%2FStyle%2FURI')\">an article by Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web) written in 1998</a>.</p>\n<p>That was fifteen years ago, and yet it holds much wisdom.</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox quote margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-quote\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <blockquote>\n<p>When you change a URI on your server, you can never completely tell who will have links to the old URI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><p>Let it be search engines, other sites or people storing your resources in their bookmarks — changing URLs sucks. People will curse you. You're breaking the web.</p>\n<p>I made the major mistake of letting WordPress choose my URLs for me. Of course, that wasn't Wordpress's fault but rather my greenhorn oversight. But the problem still holds for any technology out there.</p>\n<p>Next.js, Netlify, Amplify — frameworks and hosters — come with URL defaults. What happens if I change frameworks or hosting? Will I break my URLs? How often do I map something living in the <code><wbr>.netlify</code> directory to something futureproof? Well, the answer is: rarely.</p>\n<p>Tim says:</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox quote margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-quote\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <p>It is the the duty of a Webmaster to allocate URIs which you will be able to stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200 years. This needs thought, and organization, and commitment.</p>\n</div><p>Alright, captain! I'm not a webmaster but phew, that's easier said than done in practice. For example, this post here lives under a <code>/notes/*</code> URL. I thought it's fancy at first, but it's not a great future-proven URL. What happens if I restructure the content types (notes, blogs, tilPosts) on my blog? Will <code>/notes/</code> still make sense? I doubt it.</p>\n<p>And again, the technology I use (Contentful/Eleventy) decided on the URL structure – it was again me not thinking long-term.</p>\n<p>URLs will be tough forever, but we simply have to try to avoid link rot. Give <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FProvider%2FStyle%2FURI')\">&quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;</a> a read if you want some URL inspiration.</p>\n<p>And a sidenote: <strong>if you don't put dates and metadata on your pages, please start doing it. If URLs don't change, it's important to know when things were created or updated</strong>. 😉</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox info margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-info\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <p>With social media being a huge content resource today, <a href=\"https://benmyers.dev/blog/native-visually-hidden/#which-snippet-should-you-use\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fbenmyers.dev%2Fblog%2Fnative-visually-hidden%2F%23which-snippet-should-you-use')\">I discovered that Ben Myers avoids broken resources by linking to socials via <code>web<wbr>.archive<wbr>.org</code></a>.

How do you version a <code>beta</code> release? Should projects start with <code>1<wbr>.0<wbr>.0</code>, <code>0<wbr>.1<wbr>.0</code> or <code>0<wbr>.0<wbr>.1</code>? And do you follow proper <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fsemver.org%2F')\">semantic versioning</a> or not?</p>\n<p>I don't hold strong opinions here, but I do care about setting expectations appropriately. When I update a dependency, I'd like to know if there are expected breaking changes or if it's supposed to be a smooth ride.</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox info margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-info\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <p>The idea of a breaking change is by itself very complicated. Let's say there's a bug in your software; when people already use your code there's a slight chance that a bug fix could also be a breaking change.</p>\n<p>But I'll leave this topic for another day...</p>\n</div><p>It really doesn't matter what numbers you slap onto your package, but folks depending on your code should get guidance on what to expect.</p>\n<p>And this is when things get more complicated. How do you communicate these breaking changes?</p>\n<p>Suppose you install a new package via <code>npm</code>: you'll find a caret range definition (<code>^</code>) in your <code>package<wbr>.json</code> for your installed package. But what versions does <a href=\"https://github.com/npm/node-semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnpm%2Fnode-semver%23caret-ranges-123-025-004')\">a caret range include</a>?</p>\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n<pre><code>^1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0-0\n^0.2.3 := &gt;=0.2.3 &lt;0.3.0-0\n^0.0.3 := &gt;=0.0.3 &lt;0.0.4-0\n</code></pre>\n<p>And you see that right — <strong>the <code>^</code> behaves differently depending on the overall version number</strong>.</p>\n<p>For every package that reached <code>1<wbr>.0<wbr>.0</code> already, <code>^1<wbr>.0<wbr>.0</code> includes all updates up to but excluding <code>2<wbr>.0<wbr>.0</code>. Contrary, if you're dealing with a zero-leading package, it'll only go up to the left-most non-zero element in the version number. <code>^0<wbr>.3<wbr>.0</code> only accepts <code>0<wbr>.3<wbr>.x</code> releases.</p>\n<p>The idea behind this is the communication of breaking changes that are &quot;somewhat&quot; based on semantic versioning. SemVer defines it is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>x.y.z -&gt; 2.3.1\n\nx change: backwards incompatible changes are introduced\ny change: new features are included but everything's backwards compatible\nz change: backwards compatible bug fixes are included\n</code></pre>\n<p>And following, according to SemVer <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fsemver.org%2F')\">everything pre <code>1<wbr>.0<wbr>.0</code> should be considered a breaking change</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox quote margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-quote\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <blockquote>\n<p>Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><p>But in practice and enforced by npm: going from <code>0<wbr>.4<wbr>.0</code> to <code>0<wbr>.5<wbr>.0</code> is considered a breaking change.</p>\n<p>Do your dependency maintainers follow this rule? I don't know — but it proves the points once more that you should rely on proper test coverage and don't treat dependency updates lightly.</p>\n<p>The next breaking change is just around the corner! 🥷</p>\n</div>\n\n          <hr>\n          <a href=\"mailto:stefanjudis@gmail.com?subject=Re%3A%20The problem of breaking changes and version numbers\">\n            Reply to Stefan\n          </a>\n        ",

But there's one command that isn't, and it can cause real headaches — <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fgit-scm.com%2Fdocs%2Fgit-clean')\"><code>git clean</code></a>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token comment\"># remove all untracked files</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> clean <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>clean</code> command removes untracked files from your Git working tree, and while that's sometimes exactly what you want, you should really run the command with caution.</p>\n<p>You're probably frustrated when you want to start over, but you should be sure you want to throw away everything. Some files might still be valuable. If you run <code>git clean</code>, they're gone — end of story.</p>\n<div class=\"highlightBox info margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n      \n          <div class=\"cornerBubble\">\n            <svg aria-hidden=\"true\">\n              <use xlink:href=\"#icon-info\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        \n\n      \n      <p>By default, Git will not allow you to clean up a repository unless you have <code>clean<wbr>.requireForce</code> set to <code>false</code>. But you know how it is: an innocent <code>-f</code> is quickly added.</p>\n</div><p>I learned today that <code>git clean</code> (and other commands) support a <code>--dry-run</code> option.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clean --dry-run <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">.</span>\nWould remove not-important.js\nWould remove untracked-but-very-important.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want a shorter command line option, use the very intuitive (not!) <code>-n</code> argument.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clean <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-n</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">.</span>\nWould remove not-important.js\nWould remove untracked-but-very-important.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>The command prints out what it would remove without doing any damage. Handy! It also comes with a useful interactive mode to handle many untracked files.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clean <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-i</span>\nWould remove the following items:\n  not-important.js   untracked-but-very-important.js\n  \n*** Commands ***\n  <span class=\"token number\">1</span>: clean   <span class=\"token number\">2</span>: filter by pattern   <span class=\"token number\">3</span>: <span class=\"token keyword\">select</span> by numbers   <span class=\"token number\">4</span>: ask each   <span class=\"token number\">5</span>: quit   <span class=\"token number\">6</span>: <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">help</span>\nWhat now<span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\nRemove not-important.js <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>y/N<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>? y\nRemove untracked-but-very-important.js <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>y/N<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>? N\nRemoving not-important.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can choose between pattern matching or checking each file one by one in the interactive mode. Nice one, Git! 💪</p>\n<p>But what about other Git commands? Most of the other dry runs don't seem very exciting to me because, as said, most of the Git operations are reversible. But one that I could see come in handy is a <code>git remote prune</code> dry run to avoid removing remote branches. But that's about it. 🤷‍♂️</p>\n</div>\n\n          <hr>\n          <a href=\"mailto:stefanjudis@gmail.com?subject=Re%3A%20How to safely remove untracked files from Git repos\">\n            Reply to Stefan\n          </a>\n        ",

They include hand-written shell scripts to create symlinks, download all desktop apps and CLI tools, and get my preferred system settings in place. But overall, they've become a Frankenstein over time because many random scripts are doing random things. And obviously, I failed to document what's going on properly.</p>\n<p>Sure, scripts have to run to install stuff, but for config file management, most solutions I've seen seemed too complicated to keep some files in sync. And I really don't want to use a dotfile framework to pull some configuration files.</p>\n<p>What if there is a way to tweak Git and track all the <code><wbr>.*rc</code> and <code>config</code> files?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mitxela.com/projects/dotfiles_management\" style=\"--image-url: url('https://avatar.stefanjudis.com/https%3A%2F%2Fmitxela.com%2Fprojects%2Fdotfiles_management')\">&quot;Dotfiles management&quot;</a> describes Git magic to track all files somewhere on your machine from a single <code><wbr>.git</code> repository. Yes, your read that right. Any file and anywhere.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">alias</span> <span class=\"token assign-left variable\">dotfiles</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">'git --git-dir=/home/mx/.dotfiles --work-tree=/'</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's right; there's a <code><wbr>.git</code> folder somewhere on your machine (<code>/home/mx/<wbr>.dotfiles</code> in the example), and it'll track all the files no matter where they're located, thanks to the <code>--work-tree</code> argument. Then there's no symlink dance!</p>\n<p>With some additional configuration, you can add and sync files across machines without scripts using <code>dotfiles add</code> or <code>dotfiles commit</code>. It's all just plain Git.</p>\n<p>This dotfiles approach is by far the smartest I've seen, and I'll definitely give it a shot when I fiddle with my system config the next time.</p>\n</div>\n\n          <hr>\n          <a href=\"mailto:stefanjudis@gmail.com?subject=Re%3A%20Git-based dotfile management without symlinks\">\n            Reply to Stefan\n          </a>\n        ",

Sometimes I feel like I have things under control, but other times, I'm looking at a type definition at work, and all I can do is scratch my head in confusion. It'll be a long journey!</p>\n<p>Today I discovered a somewhat basic but very useful feature that's in TS since <code>3<wbr>.4</code> (released in 2019). That's a century in web development, but hey, I'm still starting out!</p>\n<div class=\"heading-wrapper\">\n      <a class=\"margin-left-s text-no-underline\" aria-label=\"Link to heading\" aria-describedby=\"how-to-narrow-types-with-%60const%60-assertions\" href=\"#how-to-narrow-types-with-%60const%60-assertions\">\n        <svg class=\"icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n          <use xlink:href=\"#icon-link\"/>\n        </svg>\n      </a>\n      <h2 id=\"how-to-narrow-types-with-%60const%60-assertions\">How to narrow types with <code>const</code> assertions</h2></div><p>Let's look at a trivial example.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> resource <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>id<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'123'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>resource<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>id <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">'234'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token builtin\">console</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'yay!'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you look at it, you'll probably see that there's no way this code logs out <code>yay!</code> because the <code>resource<wbr>.id</code> isn't changed to <code>234</code>. But TypeScript doesn't know that, and if you inspect the resulting type, you'll find that <code>resource<wbr>.id</code> is just a <code>string</code>. And that does make sense because it doesn't matter if you declare an object with the <code>const</code> keyword; you can still change the properties as you like.</p>\n<p>\n      <div class=\"sqip-container margin-top-l margin-bottom-l\">\n        <figure class=\"sqip-image\" style=\"\n          --color1: rgb(100,156,212);

To be fair, there are fewer quirks than ten years ago, but some things would still make great language additions.

They can be rendered on the server or (very much less preferably) on the client. They may or may not need interactivity or client-side JavaScript. And unlike heftier legacy frameworks like React, when you need to add interactivity they can still be extremely lightweight by leveraging (dare I say it…) The Platform™ <em>*audible gasp*</em>.</p>\n<p>But let’s not get distracted from the task at hand: we want to evaluate a few different options on the table to apply styles (CSS) to our web components.</p>\n<p>Here are the things we want to think about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>. We don’t want styles from distinct components to interfere with each other (that’s what this blog post is here for, after all).</li>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong>. Predictably, a method popularized for CSS encapsulation (CSS-in-JS) was less than ideal because it was slow-by-default. Let’s keep performance at the forefront of our minds.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser compatibility</strong>. Let’s not go so far out on the cutting edge that we leave some of our visitors behind.</li>\n<li><strong>Code re-use without duplication</strong>, during both authoring and the output. We want to streamline our output to avoid sending any more code down the wire than we need to.</li>\n<li><strong>Client-side framework independent</strong>. The methods described in this post do not use any client-side libraries or frameworks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Methods for encapsulated styles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/styling-web-components/#1.-declarative-shadow-dom\">Declarative Shadow DOM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/styling-web-components/#2.-shadow-dom\">Shadow DOM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/styling-web-components/#3.-webc\">WebC</a></li>\n<li>Future bonus method: <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/styling-web-components/#4.-css-@scope\">CSS <code>@scope</code></a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"1.-declarative-shadow-dom\" tabindex=\"-1\">1.

      "value": "<p>If you’re trying to build a single page application (SPA), you should probably use a tool designed primarily for the job. Site generators focused on performance, shipping low to zero-client-JavaScript (e.g. the one I work on, <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>) typically use full page navigations. SPA advocates have rebranded this architecture as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) but fundamentally this is how the web has always operated.</p>\n<p>Classic multi-page architecture has a few benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better empty-cache performance</strong>: your site can render faster.\n<ul>\n<li>As web browsers become more privacy-focused and users spread their browsing across multiple web-capable devices, empty-caches visits are increasingly common.</li>\n<li>Faster sites make more money. Read <a href=\"https://wpostats.com/\">WPO Stats</a>.</li>\n<li>Search engines use <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience\">site performance as a search ranking signal</a>, which makes good performance crucial.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Inclusive and robust by default</strong>: You are in full control the minimum requirements necessary to visit your site. You needn’t put any undue burden on the capabilities of the web browser of your visitors. You needn’t place your site behind a “Best Viewed In” browser-compatibility warning. If they can view HTML, they can view your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy-efficiency</strong>: Lighter pages result in safer long sessions that are more energy efficient and won’t drain your visitors’ laptop or mobile device batteries.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy-focused</strong>: working without client-JavaScript allows visitors full control over their viewing experience. This allows you to create sites that work best in the harsh real world environment of browser extensions, content and ad-blockers; even working with those rare folks that browse with JavaScript disabled.</li>\n<li><strong>Searchable by default</strong>: A simpler architecture for server rendered content makes it straightforward for search engines to find you.</li>\n<li><strong>Better defaults</strong> for accessibility-focused page navigations, preserving scroll position, forward/back button support, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Single Page Application frameworks in the last few years have pivoted away from client-side rendering to server-rendering and we welcome this improvement. However, the large starting size of client JavaScript bundles customary to SPA persist: Remix (228 kB), Next.js (248 kB), Gatsby (210 kB), and Nuxt (191 kB) <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/site-generator-review/#client-javascript-baseline\" class=\"notes_link\">source</a>. Notably, these large bundle sizes are only the minimum for a Hello World project and will only grow as your project grows (and as the frameworks grow over time, too).</p>\n<p>You can’t JavaScript your way out of an excess-JavaScript problem. <strong>These large JavaScript bundles are costly to site performance.</strong></p>\n<p>Single Page Application advocates argue these large, costly bundles enable performance gains for future navigations, seamless media playback during transition, and fancy transition animations. While we can debate (and even agree on some of) those points (recognizing also that they will fade into irrelevance as the web platform progresses), take a moment to consider <strong>whether or not this trade-off should be made for you as a default</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>data supports the case that Single Page Applications are a bad default for the web</strong> too. An analysis of Core Web Vitals across 9.3 million web sites in February 2023 <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/55bc8fad-44c2-4280-aa0b-5f3f0cd3d2be/page/M6ZPC?s=lD9m_MQgyGU\">shows that only 26% of sites built using the most popular Single Page Application framework (Next.js) have good Core Web Vitals</a>, far lower than the web at large (40%).</p>\n<h2 id=\"alternatives\" tabindex=\"-1\">Alternatives <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/single-page-applications/#alternatives\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Learn more about alternative approaches that can provide some of the same SPA benefits without the drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/\">View Transitions API</a> to do smooth cross-page animations on navigation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pepelsbey/pepelsbey.dev/commit/accf0da\">Example code using the View Transitions API in an Eleventy project</a> from Vadim Makeev.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/blog/prefetching/\">Predictive Prefetching can speed up navigations</a>.</li>\n<li>Prefetching JavaScript libraries:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://getquick.link/\">quicklink</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://instant.page/\">instant.page</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"trade-offs\" tabindex=\"-1\">Trade-offs <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/single-page-applications/#trade-offs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/\">Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications</a> by Manuel Matuzović.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://scribe.rip/@jason.godesky/when-javascript-fails-52eef47e90db\">When JavaScript Fails</a> by Jason Godesky.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2017/netflix-and-react/\">Netflix functions without client-side React, and it’s a good thing</a> by Jake Archibald.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1433317536754458628\">SPA navigation may be slower than MPA navigation</a>, a tweet from Jake Archibald.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1169998370041208832/\">Which has a better FMP? 8.5 MB of HTML or one SPA-rendered Tweet</a></li>\n</ul>",

tabindex=\"-1\">npm Auditing <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/site-generator-review/#npm-auditing\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some frameworks use <code>create-*</code> packages (sometimes with <code>npm init</code>) and include a step that helpfully installs your <code>npm</code> dependencies for you. However, some of these tools also hide npm auditing results (including those about high severity security vulnerabilities).</p>\n<p>These tools hide <code>npm audit</code> reports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astro ⚠️</li>\n<li>Gatsby ⚠️</li>\n<li>Next ⚠️ (via bundling its dependencies)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools show standard <code>npm audit</code> reports during project creation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eleventy ✅</li>\n<li>Enhance ✅</li>\n<li>Nuxt ✅</li>\n<li>Remix ✅</li>\n<li>SvelteKit ✅</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"telemetry\" tabindex=\"-1\">Telemetry <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/site-generator-review/#telemetry\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Telemetry is the practice of collecting anonymous data on usage of the tool. Some tools have this enabled (opt-in) by default and require an opt-out. This isn’t necessarily bad but some folks are very surprised by this default (and education here is important as this default may not comply with your organization’s security policies).</p>\n<p>These tools require you to opt-out of Telemetry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astro ⚠️</li>\n<li>Next.js ⚠️</li>\n<li>Gatsby ⚠️</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Has Telemetry but it prompts you to ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nuxt <em>(see additional nuance below)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>No known Telemetry or data collection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eleventy ✅</li>\n<li>Enhance ✅</li>\n<li>Remix ✅</li>\n<li>SvelteKit ✅</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>February 28, 2023 this note was updated with more accurate information on Nuxt with help from Nuxt maintainers.</em></p>\n<p>Notably and delightfully, Nuxt prompts to ask if you want to participate in Telemetry when you first run the development server. This is a global preference and you will only be prompted once; it applies to all Nuxt projects on your machine (stored in a <code>~/.nuxtrc</code> file).</p>\n<p>This prompt is still technically opt-out when using the development server. The default answer to the prompt is Yes, to participate in telemetry. But the prompt <em>does not execute</em> on deployment servers and CI pipelines, so it’s actually <em>opt-in</em> in those contexts. To me this seems like a well-executed middle ground.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback\" tabindex=\"-1\">Feedback <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/site-generator-review/#feedback\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let me know if you have feedback—I’d also welcome recommendations on aspects of these tools that you’d like to see reviewed for next time!</p>\n<svg style=\"position: absolute; left: -9999px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden\">\n  <defs>\n    <linearGradient id=\"gradient-sunrise-h\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#F0047F\"></stop>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#FC814A\"></stop>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"gradient-sunrise-v\" x1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y1=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#F0047F\"></stop>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#FC814A\"></stop>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"gradient-blue-h\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#0090c9\"></stop>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#00c0ad\"></stop>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"gradient-blue-v\" x1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y1=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#0090c9\"></stop>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#00c0ad\"></stop>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"gradient-sun-h\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFC803\"></stop>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#FC814A\"></stop>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"gradient-sun-v\" x1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y1=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFC803\"></stop>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#FC814A\"></stop>\n    </linearGradient>\n  </defs>\n</svg>",

It showed an average React performance baseline of 1.26 seconds to first render on a mobile device over 3G, when performance guidelines recommended a goal of first render in under one second.</p>\n<p>The React popularization of client-side rendering did not exist in a vacuum. It was happening <em>as</em> developers struggled to make this model of client-side React work on an increasingly diverse and demanding world-wide mobile device landscape, especially as <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1262795599390420994\">Responsive Web Design won</a> over m-dot architectures for most web work.</p>\n<div data-demo-label=\"Side Note\" class=\"livedemo\">\n<p><em>I’m reminded of Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBp_xCGIATk\">admitting that Facebook bet <em>too much</em> on HTML5 for mobile</a>, although I haven’t seen a connection between that 2012 quote and React’s initial release in 2013.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>In the post, John states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are practical approaches we can already use today to reliably produce very fast rendering times, but they work best when HTML content is delivered from the server side rather than generating it solely on the client.

Looking back at those old posts, it seems like I wrote some very bland listicles that wrapped up the different web development community work and side projects that happened during the year. This year I’m just gonna write free-form and see what happens 😅.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source\" tabindex=\"-1\">Open Source <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/icymi/2022/#open-source\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Probably the biggest news this year is that Eleventy graduated from side project to full time sponsorship (thank you <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>!!) in February and <em>everything</em> changed.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the before-times, I’m not sure how I managed this project without full time sponsorship.</p>\n<p>The most important thing I’m doing in my life is being a dad. I’m reminded of the <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/jamstackconf-oss-panel/\">Jamstack Conf panel</a> a few months back. The moderator asked panelists “What do you like to do in your free time?” and my first thought, best thought was: I’m a dad—what do you mean <em>free time</em>?</p>\n<p>When Eleventy started in 2017, I had a two year old daughter. We <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1087687651749052416/\">grew our family through adoption</a> in 2019. Juggling a family, full time job, and an open source project for 4 (almost 5?) years is a lot. It’s awkward to both be proud of what you’ve accomplished (I worked <em>so</em> hard) and disappointed with knowing that you could do more if you just had more time.</p>\n<p>For me this manifested primarily with the number of languishing pull requests on Eleventy core. When you only have a few hours a week to work on a side project—you make some pretty hard choices. Do I fix this bug? Do I work on a feature that I think is super important for the future of the project? Or do I merge in a feature that someone else prioritized (a pull request that may not even have automated tests 😱)?</p>\n<p>In retrospect, I wish I had been more honest with contributors—but I don’t think that I understood the diminishing returns on optimism. No matter how productive you are, the upper limit is still the number of hours in the day. And I couldn’t keep the project afloat while doing justice to the larger external contributions that were coming in. In retrospect, I think putting an organizational hard limit on the size of pull requests might have helped manage expectations better (e.g. “I will only review pull requests with fewer than 50 changes”).</p>\n<p>On top of that, I also recognize that <em>merging</em> a pull request is maybe even the easiest bit of the arrangement. It’s the emotional drag that comes in from long term maintenance of that code that is the harder sell. Do I want to maintain this feature? Will my heart sink when I see issues come in on this? Those were the tolls of the side project open source maintainer.</p>\n<p>With full time sponsorship generously provided by Netlify, <em>everything has changed</em>.</p>\n<p>We’ve been able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Release 28 versions across the stable and canary channels.</li>\n<li>Close 823 issues (<strong>+73% year over year</strong>) and 349 pull requests across the <code>11ty</code> GitHub organization.</li>\n<li>Our open pull request count on core is down to 15 🥳.</li>\n<li>We have 4.5 million total cumulative downloads on npm (<strong>+40% year over year</strong>).</li>\n<li>We <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/build-benchmark/\">benchmarked markdown processing</a> and found that we’re rivaling Hugo, the current performance champ.</li>\n<li>Participate on <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/?category=speaking#2022\">14 different Eleventy talks/panels/podcasts/streams/Twitter spaces</a>.</li>\n<li>We’re shipping a stable 2.0 version in the next few weeks, including:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/incremental/\">Incremental builds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dev-server/\">The Eleventy Dev Server</a> (no more browsersync by default)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/\">WebC</a>, a new single file web component format/compiler.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/partial-hydration/\"><code>&lt;is-land&gt;</code></a>, a new web component for partial hydration.</li>\n<li>A new <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/edge/\">Edge rendering plugin</a> as well as plugins for Vite, i18n, and more!</li>\n<li>Stay tuned for the full 2.0 changelog!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Start an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/EleventyVideo\">Eleventy YouTube channel</a> (1K+ subs) and an <a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy\"><code>@eleventy@fosstodon.org</code></a> Mastodon account (1.9K+ follows).</li>\n<li>Continue with our <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/\">Eleventy Discord server</a> (2.4K+ members).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, I no longer feel as though I’m treading water.

With 9 entries on the <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/blog/\">Eleventy Blog</a> and 32 videos on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/EleventyVideo\">Eleventy YouTube channel</a>, I’m definitely posting more than ever!</p>\n<p>The top two blog posts last year were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/trailing-slash/\">Trailing Slashes on URLs: Contentious or Settled?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/build-benchmark/\">Which Generator Builds Markdown the Fastest?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The top two videos last year were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Bpjrkz-V8\">Crash Course in Eleventy’s new WebC Plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0wDUK0Z5Nw\">Interactive Progressively-enhanced Web Components with WebC</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"twitter\" tabindex=\"-1\">Twitter <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/icymi/2022/#twitter\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One of the most disheartening turns of 2022 was the demise of Twitter. I spent <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/1462873/\">16 years on Twitter</a>. I loved Twitter. I got <em>a lot</em> out of relationships that I built on Twitter. I wasn’t a fan of M*sk before and <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/vote-with-your-tweet/\">his standing in my eyes has not improved</a>.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t feel like a small thing to ice both the <code>@zachleat</code> (24K+ follows) and <code>@eleven_ty</code> (12.5K+ follows) accounts. I don’t know that it was the smartest move but it still feels like the right one.</p>\n<p>It <em>has</em> been heartening to see other folks take similar principled stands against the parade of unethical behavior from the company, not limited to the many folks <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/tweetback/\">backing up their twitter archives</a> to sites that they control as they begin to divorce themselves from the site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal\" tabindex=\"-1\">Personal <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/icymi/2022/#personal\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The family and kids are doing great. The kids keep me on my toes and continue to amaze with what they’re capable of.</p>\n<p>The kids both retired the training wheels on their bikes this last month and it was such a big reminder of how absolutely exhilarating it is to see someone succeed at something after struggling with it! The 7 year old is absolutely obsessed with reading right now and I will vociferously debate anyone that disputes the value of public libraries.</p>\n<p>Excitingly, the kids are also now old enough to <em>really play video games</em>. Our favorites in the past year have been <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-switch/\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/arms-switch/\">ARMS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch/\">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/overcooked-2-switch/\">Overcooked 2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/diablo-iii-eternal-collection-switch/\">Diablo III</a>. There are also a ton of <a href=\"https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/109577086600908024\">very excellent suggestions in this Mastodon thread</a> (thank you everyone!).</p>\n<p>I’d also shout out to <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/gris-switch/\">Gris</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/torchlight-iii-switch/\">Torchlight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/deaths-door-switch/\">Death’s Door</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/bastion-switch/\">Bastion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/hades-switch/\">Hades</a> too—noting that those were single-player games and not cooperative. Those last two recommendations put me firmly in the <a href=\"https://www.supergiantgames.com/\">Supergiant Games</a> fan club I think.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thank-you-notes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Thank You Notes <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/icymi/2022/#thank-you-notes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It isn’t possible to overstate how none of this would be imaginable, let alone achievable without the support and labor of my partner and wife. Open source is not just a privilege—it <em>is</em> privilege—and there is so much work that goes on behind the scenes (emotional and otherwise).</p>\n<p>A huge thank you to Netlify titans Matt Biilmann, Chris Bach, Lauren Sell (alum), and Claire Knight: all of whom fought for and are to thank for the Netlify Eleventy sponsorship.</p>\n<p>And everyone in the Eleventy community who have supported us over the years, especially: <a href=\"https://about.me/peterdehaan\">Peter deHaan</a>, <a href=\"https://benmyers.dev/\">Ben Myers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cassey.dev/\">Cassey Lottman</a>, <a href=\"https://danleatherman.com/\">Dan Leatherman</a>, <a href=\"https://darthmall.net/\">Evan Sheehan</a>, <a href=\"https://helloyes.dev/\">Thomas M. Semmler</a>, <a href=\"https://sia.codes/\">Sia Karamalegos</a>, and <a href=\"https://thinkdobecreate.com/\">Stephanie Eckles</a>.</p>\n<p>So many folks have made the last year possible and I’m grateful to you all.</p>\n<p>Keep building for the web ❤️.</p>",

      "value": "<p><em>Twitter, it’s not me—it’s you.</em></p>\n<p>In October of 2019, I gave a talk at Jamstack Conf San Francisco titled <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-your-content/\">Owning your Content on Social Media</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For this talk I built a social media platform: MySpaceBook.​info, the only social media site exclusively for astronauts. Unfortunately midway through the presentation an investor called me up to make an offer on the site and I was left with no choice but to sell it, taking all of the user data down with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apropros of nothing and in no way related to the scenario foretold in prophecy, <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/vote-with-your-tweet/\">I’m no longer hanging around on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>In the Jamstack Conf talk, I went through how one might build a local archive of your Twitter content, <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-my-tweets/\">as I had done and documented separately</a> a month or two prior. This archive now lives at <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/\"><code>zachleat.com/twitter/</code></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Cue crickets.</em></p>\n<p>As Eleventy started to take off, I suddenly had very limited time to dedicate to cleaning up this archive for others to use. A lot of folks asked me about it and whether I was going to open source it. I always punted—it felt like an open source burden that I just didn’t have the bandwidth to take on. This continued for, well… years! Until a few weeks ago when long-time Eleventy community member <a href=\"https://nicolas-hoizey.com/\"><img alt=\"IndieWeb Avatar for https://nicolas-hoizey.com\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://v1.indieweb-avatar.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fnicolas-hoizey.com/\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"z-avatar\" />Nicolas Hoizey</a> volunteered to help maintain the thing!</p>\n<h2 id=\"tweetback\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tweetback <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/tweetback/#tweetback\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h2>\n<p>And thus, <a href=\"https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback/\"><strong>Tweetback</strong> was shipped</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"build-performance-at-scale\" tabindex=\"-1\">Build Performance at Scale <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/tweetback/#build-performance-at-scale\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"direct-link\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Tweetback is built with <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> and I do think Eleventy plays a special role here. Eleventy is a production ready, stable site generator that now has very concrete public proof of <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/twitter/\">~50,000</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.nicolas-hoizey.com/\">&gt; 100,000</a> page builds.</p>\n<p>Given tests previously conducted across a variety of site generators in the JavaScript ecosystem, this reveals the unique space that Eleventy lives in (and a competitive advantage). With all due respect to the unique capabilities of other tools, I do not think <a href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/build-benchmark/\">Next.js or Gatsby or Astro would be able to handle a similar scale of project</a>.

Though I will admit it is a tad bit unexpected to folks that have tied their pre-hydrated CSS to the original tag name (I’d suggest using a <code>class</code> instead!).</p>\n<p>However, some component frameworks have started <a href=\"https://github.com/webcomponents-cg/community-protocols/pull/15\">adopting a community-agreed-upon draft standard</a>: using a <code>defer-hydration</code> attribute on a component to denote that the component code will instead handle lazy initialization (when the attribute is removed).</p>\n<p>Personally, I’d love to see this as part of a web standard first-party supported in browsers without requiring <em>any</em> userland component code changes. The first step to make this a viable formal standard in the future is to encourage folks to adopt the community protocol in their component code today!</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/is-land/issues/14\"><code>&lt;is-land&gt;</code> v3.0.0 now supports <code>defer-hydration</code></a> to skip the custom element tag rename and let the component code handle deferred hydration itself. Here’s how it might work:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>is-land</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\"><span class=\"token namespace\">on:</span>visible</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">&gt;</span></span>\n\t<span
